# Switchboard Data

This dir contains training and testing files from the Penn Treebank-3 Switchboard corpus splitted as follows:
- `train.txt` consists of the sw[23]∗.mrg files
- `dev.txt` consists of the sw4[5-9]∗.mrg files
- `test.txt` consists of the sw4[0-1]∗.mrg files

Switchboard is not an open-source corpus, and you need to get it from [Linguistic Data Consortium](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC97S62).
