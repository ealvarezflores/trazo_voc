# swbd-data: Switchboard data

## Directories

* [autopos-nopunct-pw](autopos-nopunct-pw): POS-tagged files, without any punctuation but with partial words.

This dir contains three files, `train.txt`, `dev.txt` and `test.txt`, which are the train, development and test data.
Since Switchboard is not an open source data, you need to get it from [Linguistic Data Consortium](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC97S62).
