[Leonardo Cipriani]
There is something called shop drawings, which is a technical drawing thing. That you need to have some technical knowledge. Of But this is something that I know in this industry from every part of the industry. Everybody's desperate for that. Because no one has a company here that they can rely on, they try to do themselves. And then whenever you're trying to do which is my case I have seven interior designs, designers and architects around the world working for themselves to do that. It's not that they were meant to do that. They were interior designers or architects.

[Leonardo Cipriani]
Because I paid them. in dollars. They're working for me and they are doing. Not because they want to, they're just doing it for the money.

[Leonardo Cipriani]
The thing is the designers and architects they have on this side of the. Is more like creativity, innovation, it has to look But our brain, we are not very. How can I explain that? Our brain doesn't really work process, step by step, like engineering, your guys mind. So we fuck it up all the time.

[Leonardo Cipriani]
So I'm saying that to you.

[Leonardo Cipriani]
No, just try to imagine yourself as a designer. So you're a designer, you need to think about colors matching this with that, blah. So your brain works more into this side of the job. But there's another side of which is the boring part, which is the technical part. But designers, they keep doing shit that doesn't work. So it works in their mind. Putting whenever you try to build something, it doesn't work. And I work with the best interior designers in Florida.

[Leonardo Cipriani]
And they don't know. Whatever they're doing is completely wrong.

[Leonardo Cipriani]
So they don't know.

[Leonardo Cipriani]
So it's always a fight. go ahead.

[Leonardo Cipriani]
So they, what I do rely on them is the design. The design is how it looks. So they look that they want. Yes, they do. They do it. Amazing. It's a wow job. But the way they think we're going to create that, it's wrong. So they think we're gonna build in a way, but this way that they think doesn't really work. So then we have to show them on my end, on my shop, say, listen, Ada, I know what you're trying to but this way you're thinking, we cannot build this way. We're gonna have to do it this way. But we're gonna get to where you want. But why do they got

[Leonardo Cipriani]
It's just I am a company, Casa Petrus, that I am and I have people here to do everything here myself. But most of the new workers, they have nobody. So the designers try to tell them what they want because they don't really know what they're doing. So the designers try to tell the new worker what they should do, you know?

[Leonardo Cipriani]
And that's why there's always a fighting between the designers and the mill workers. And when I say new workers, I'm also saying about any other vendors that can be the general contractor, that can be the floor guy, that can be the ceiling guy, whatever.

[Leonardo Cipriani]
Because the way you execute the work is going to affect the design, the way it looks. And that's why designers hate vendors and vendors hate designers.

[Leonardo Cipriani]
So I have. It depends on the level of company you're talking about. So Design Solutions, they are a great company. So they have great people working, they've been in business for a long time, so they are already more structured as a company. So they will send me a full ID set. The ID set has a render of how they want it to look, they have details of how they want it to be built, blah, all the info. But most of the designers, you get a package that's just a few renders from Pinterest, from Instagram, whatever. This is more or less what I was looking for. So you have those two worlds got like, in the designers and also in the vendors. So Me as a vendor now, I have shop drawings.

[Leonardo Cipriani]
And what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna send you a ID package that I received from a designer and what I give it them when they sign a contract with me with all my shop joins. And sometimes they send me one page of a render and I send them back 20 pages of shop joints explaining to them detail by detail. So as soon as they sign, they know what they are getting in the end.

[Leonardo Cipriani]
All of the work that I do here is custom.

[Leonardo Cipriani]
No, full time.

[Leonardo Cipriani]
Working full time.

[Leonardo Cipriani]
Because it cost me a lot of money. So I have seven people here to do shop drawings. I have 37 people in my company, seven of them. So like 20, 30% of my companies just to do stupid shop drawings. So designers can sign and I can build. So it's a lot of cost on my end. That's why other build workers and other vendors, they don't actually do shop drawings. They ask you to find the render and they build upon the render. If it's on my shop joints, my responsibility. If it's not, it's their responsibility.

[Leonardo Cipriani]
But one thing is for sure, they are never surprised with my work because whatever I'm gonna cut before I cut. They already know what I'm doing. Those seven people that works for it's just to really make it a clear vision of the future so there is no miscommunication, blah, Nothing like that.

[Leonardo Cipriani]
Because even though I have seven people here, they still make a lot of mistakes on my company. And when I say my company, I am not a small guy, but I'm like, the best huge guy as well. I still make And I see the companies from Italy that like, 200 years old, they still make a lot of fucking mistakes. And that cost us a lot of money because I do custom. So if I cut something it's not just the piece itself. I also lacquer. So I do lacquer on or I do wood on top. I do stain on top. So cutting wrong. And then I have another six, seven steps of the process that I'm working on a piece that is wrong from the beginning. And I didn't know. And I'm only gonna realize that when I'm installing.

[Leonardo Cipriani]
If it's wrong on the shop drawings, I'm gonna be 100 wrong until the end.

[Leonardo Cipriani]
Yes, I'm 100% on that. Maybe it wouldn't work now for me as Casa Pentos, because I have this whole structure here already to start working with a company like that. But 99% of the new workers, they don't have the instruction that I have So they would be like, thank you, that you guys exist. They have no one now. They have zero people doing shop have

[Leonardo Cipriani]
You know, maybe I wouldn't work with you guys, but most of the vendors, yes, they would love you guys, because if you met me two years ago, I would have hired you. Gotcha.

[Leonardo Cipriani]
Between two to $3,000 a month each Person, I have people in Europe, I have person a month. I have people in Spain, I have people in but they are designers and architects. So in Brazil that's like 11, 12,000 reais a month. So that's. So it's a good salary for But if you have someone that is more like a junior or something that's working for you can pay a thousand bucks, eight hundred, twelve hundred dollars and they are happy with it.

[Leonardo Cipriani]
Because what I do here in the beginning, it's also, I'm telling you guys the end of the story. But now I am where I am. But two years ago I didn't have that much money. I didn't have that much of access to all of that I have now. So in the beginning I was paying people $800 a month and then 1500 and then 2000, now up to 3000. Because I'm growing and I'm selling more and more expensive things. So now I have the possibility to do that. But it wasn't always like that.

[Leonardo Cipriani]
I would definitely hire you guys for a few things because right now, even though I have those seven people, I still subcontract, John, sometimes with freelancers, architects, drawings people. So I still do that

[Leonardo Cipriani]
Almost every month.

[Leonardo Cipriani]
Just so you for example, I work here with projects, more or less 500,000 and more. so I have 800,000 dollar project, 1 million, $1.2 million. So the amount of details in a shop joints that goes into a $1 million project, it's insane. Yeah, I'll send you guys some shop drawings. You guys will just be able to see it. So you have one room and this room has 36 pages. But the houses I do, they have six, seven rooms and then they have a Kitchen and they have 12 closets and then they have 18 bathrooms. So.

[Leonardo Cipriani]
So whenever I have these two girls working on this Fisher island project, I don't want them to stop just to do a wall unit for me here and there. I want them to finish the Fisher island project. I don't want them to be moving around, you know?

[Leonardo Cipriani]
So sometimes I need to do one bathroom vanity or just one little closet here just to keep moving on another project, instead of me calling them, hey, stop, start doing this. I just subcontract someone. this is more like a simple job. This is what I need. Do the shop drawings for me. That's the way we do it.

[Leonardo Cipriani]
To be honest with you, it's a fucked up situation in the world right now. So if you have money, man, cash is king. It's not as easy for you to find someone that is reliable, that the motherfucker is there working for you and he's not at the beach. That's the problem. But at the same time, they are everywhere in central South America, anywhere that the dollar is a strong money. They are everywhere. You know, for someone in Brazil to be seen at home working for a company in Miami making 12,000 reais a month, It's a lot of money for them.

[Leonardo Cipriani]
We, we catered the company like that. I started doing thirty thousand dollar projects and that was four years ago. And then I raised to 50, then to 70, then to 150, then to 200, 300. I still do two hundred thousand dollar project. It's not my average now it's between five to 600.

[Leonardo Cipriani]
I can't hear you, man.

[Leonardo Cipriani]
Oh, right Now I do four or five a month. Not that I'm cutting $2 million a month. I'm not able to do that. It's just that I'm finishing up maybe one or two projects from last month. And I'm also already start working on another two new projects.

[Leonardo Cipriani]
Or I have five staples, so I have five carpenters and every carpenter is working on something different.

[Leonardo Cipriani]
Sometimes we're doing three, four projects at a time. My dream is to raise my price tag to 7, 800,000 and be doing one or two houses a month. And my. That would be a dream. In the end of the year, I have worked with 20 clients or 30 clients at the most. That would be a dream for me.

[Leonardo Cipriani]
The company Casa Bedrooms work on two, three projects a month. But then I have and sometimes one. One is doing the bathroom, the other one is doing a closet, the other one is doing the kitchen for the same project. But then everyone is doing something different.

[Leonardo Cipriani]
That's a good question. The way the designers see the world as a vendor is you have the Italian people, and they are very good, and they consider them the best.

[Leonardo Cipriani]
Most of them in my which is me, work carpentry. Kitchens, closets. Italy.

[Leonardo Cipriani]
Some of them in Brazil as well. So in the designers of mine, you have the good people, which is Italian and Brazilian and then you have the local people, That has a bad reputation to It's Hialeah people.

[Leonardo Cipriani]
The Hialeah people have no shop joints, have nothing. They're gonna do for fifth of the price. But you're gonna have to be dealing with the crazy carpenter with a big belly, you know? And that's, that's how it works. At the same time, brother, even though I'm doing this high, high end thing. The need in the United States for good Carpentry, good quality product, it's huge. So the designers, they hate to work with the Hialeah people. They don't understand design, they don't understand what it needs to be done. I see the market here in America moving, it's moving towards custom, it's moving towards the good stuff. but we are doing your local.

[Leonardo Cipriani]
So if you want to go as a shop, joins people to provide that kind of service, it's gonna, you guys gonna provide that service for the people that really want to grow towards the higher end market. Not to worse doing two three thousand dollar kitchen.

[Leonardo Cipriani]
If you take a look at the reports, everybody's spending more money now on their homes. Especially after Americans kind of realize the need of spending more time in the comfort of their homes. So they're investing more in their homes and also the price tag of a house now they are way more money. So you're not going to hire anybody to do whatever job in your house that you're killing yourself to pay your mortgage. So you want to have something is the reports of people spending more and more money towards their homes. So demand has been huge, huge.

[Leonardo Cipriani]
You know, I think they would have, they would love to have a kind of a partnership with you. Because if you guys start doing chop joints for casa you guys need to really understand the way I build things. So you guys have to kind of give me a customizable service to whatever the way I build things. Because there are many ways for you to build something and to get the same final results, it's just different ways to get there. So you guys need to understand the way I build so you guys can adapt your shop joint to. To my kind of needs, you know?

[Leonardo Cipriani]
No, I think. But this is me guessing, If I would need you guys here every month. And I'll pay a subscription. I pay you, I don't know how much dollars per And you guys work with me for a period of time. Okay, Maybe we could. Maybe maybe we could do this for a period of three months, four months. But it's not something that you're gonna come in here one and then you are out of here. It doesn't really work this way because we need to exchange a lot of you

[Leonardo Cipriani]
I would. Again today. I have the set of but if I didn't have these people, you guys have no idea how much I suffered trying to find someone in order to do that for us.

[Leonardo Cipriani]
Like, I didn't have the money to hire people to do it for myself. So for me, it was cheaper just to pay a bill, to pay an invoice for someone that would do the job for me and that knew what they were doing.

[Leonardo Cipriani]
You asked me as any new worker or you asked me as a Casa Petros.

[Leonardo Cipriani]
As Casa Petrus right now, I would give you the opportunity because I know you and And, yes, I will give you the opportunity. But right now, I already have a structure that works for me, those seven people, and I would hire you guys for the extra work that I have. I would start this way.

[Leonardo Cipriani]
And then if you guys do it and then you guys will grow inside my company, you know?

[Leonardo Cipriani]
So that's why. That's exactly what I think. You guys are getting it and I might be too. And by the way, I want to invite you guys here. The doors are open.

[Leonardo Cipriani]
You guys can have a. A better understanding of what I'm telling you guys. Whenever you guys come here, you see the way I do things here. You guys can understand who I am and where I and with all the humbleness in the world, I say that I'm a very young guy. I am nowhere close to everyone I get but at the same time, man, I'm already years ahead of 99% of the competition here.

[Leonardo Cipriani]
So I think the approach you guys have, you wouldn't be to a company like myself. I think your first approach will be to a guy that he doesn't have shop drawings at all, so he has no one. And you guys would add something to his company that he can now offer to the designers. Understood. So I think this is the big, big market for you guys, you And whenever you guys get extremely good, like, wow, you have drafters, like, the best in the world, And then you guys could come, a company like Casa Petro, and stop wasting all of this money. To the seven people you pay. How much do you pay?

[Leonardo Cipriani]
Listen, pay me this much, and I run this business for you and, like, risk free, and you don't have to worry about these people. And then I would say, it's yours, guys.

[Leonardo Cipriani]
Man, to be honest with I don't know either. It's man. They sell on the spot. So sometimes they sell a job, that $100,000 job, they think it's a lot of money. But in the end, he doesn't know if he's spending 60,000, 80,000, or if he's spending And he's losing Because whatever cost us a lot of money 250,000.

[Leonardo Cipriani]
How is this guy charging around 50? It's impossible,

[Leonardo Cipriani]
In the beginning, I always worked with the Steiner. So before having new work company, I had a stone company. So I was doing countertops And things like this. And they were always. The designers were always complaining about the millwork. So that's how I got into millwork. And I was the type of guy that, like, designer, I am here, Leo. I have a company, Casa Petros. I would like to do it good for you from the beginning. But if I do any mistake, anything, I'm gonna be here and I'm gonna redo it for you. And I understand about business. I don't understand anything about carpentry. Just so you guys know, I don't know how to build any cabins, nothing like this. I'm a business guy that got into this because of a need.

[Leonardo Cipriani]
And the way I discovered since the beginning was the problems that happens between designers and the mill workers because there is no shop drawings. No one had shop drawings. So when I started the company, I already started doing shop drawings. The first thing I did, I hired an architect from Brazil that was here in And I listen, I need you to put shop drawings So whenever I build there's no surprise between the designer and So that's how we started. I started already with that,

[Leonardo Cipriani]
Yeah, I get it. But the thing is, if you don't have shop drawings, you're not going to grow as a business towards a better quality product. So you're always going to be working as an amateur that sometimes people are going to get pissed with you and they just don't simply answer their phone anymore. And that's And this happens here every week with designers. You can ask a lot of vendors you hire, then you have a problem with them, they simply don't answer you anymore and they're gone. Those guys, I don't know, I don't have a solution for them. But if those guys, let's talk a different type of guy You are a small carpenter. You want to grow as a business, you must have some choice. It's not a question if you gotta have it.

[Leonardo Cipriani]
So in the only way for you to grow, you got. It's just like buying a car. You gotta have the.

[Leonardo Cipriani]
There's no other way for you to get there without it. And most of the guys, they remain as their amateur because they don't know how to get to this, how to, how to grow.

[Leonardo Cipriani]
And it's just And they hate to work with designers. Why they hate designers so much? Because designers always want something to be very specific in this, this way. So they rather work with homeowners that if they do any fucked ups, they already got the money in advance and fuck the homeowner. That's how they do And designers, they don't do that because designer is a business gonna come back next week, it's gonna come back next month. And homeowners, you do it today and you never see the homeowner's face again.

[Leonardo Cipriani]
I think you're actually giving them something that they always wanted to but they don't have. So I don't think it's a. It's gonna be hard to convince them. What I think it's gonna be hard for you guys is to find the right people, the right drafters that they know what they are As shop joins, I'm gonna send you guys the few options as soon as we're done. This call here, a few things for you guys to see. My shop joins, if you find the right drafters and then get this drafter to understand my company, Casa Petros, so they can build the way I want. And the next company they gonna.

[Leonardo Cipriani]
You guys gonna hire or you guys gonna sell to, you guys also need to get this briefing from this other company how they build which is probably different than Casa matters.

[Leonardo Cipriani]
So I think this is the. hard part for you guys, you know?

[Leonardo Cipriani]
But convincing my carpenter that he needs shop drawings, it's. There's no convincing. They all know they need it.

[Leonardo Cipriani]
So I have hired maybe 20, 22 people, and today I have seven people. So I keep changing them. Not that easy. But when I say not that easy, it's not about the technical part of it. It's more the personality, you know, the person. Because they're working from home, in a different country, in a different language. how it goes, I'm not there. I'm not controlling them. And I have changed not because of technical problems, but more of people problem, you know?

[Leonardo Cipriani]
Because sometimes I send you a bathroom and you take two days to get it and then I send it to another design drafter and they take a week. So I'm like, there's no way for you to take a week to do a bathroom. Yeah, it's impossible.

[Leonardo Cipriani]
If we, as a service, just so you know, only one person makes 3,000 here. She's very like. She's a senior. Senior architect. She's the only one. The average is 2,000.

[Leonardo Cipriani]
I would pay less.

[Leonardo Cipriani]
You'Re working from home or working from an office? Doesn't really change nothing for me. What really changes for me is your delivery time. So that you have. That's your problem, with your people, you gotta make them And I want to pay more money because you guys have an office, though.

[Leonardo Cipriani]
I'm saying on my end, as a client. If you guys in the end are gonna need to do that, it's another thing. But as a client, I wouldn't. mind if they're working from home or in office.

[Leonardo Cipriani]
And one thing that's very important to mention, I always have projects so I keep my people And I have other drafters that sometimes they call me, Leo, do you have a job for me? I say, what's wrong with your job? He goes, leo, sometimes I have a lot of work in one Month because the company sold a lot of projects. But then next month they have a project with you.

[Leonardo Cipriani]
If I don't have any products, I pay you guys nothing.

[Leonardo Cipriani]
So it's also a risk on my end as well.

[Leonardo Cipriani]
but sometimes I'm a little slow. And they are doing one bathroom vanity. They are working on a slow motion version of it. Let's, let's put it this way. So it cost me money to.

[Leonardo Cipriani]
Right now with the structure. I have.

[Leonardo Cipriani]
Yes, I would.

[Leonardo Cipriani]
Whatever? It's best. I don't know. But the one that has the most need is shop joints And not just with mill workers. That works with plumbing company with electrical, plumbing with gcs, with landscape company with everything.

[Leonardo Cipriani]
Just try to imagine that you had a problem in your house and you're gonna call a plumber. Do you think he's gonna come with you with a set of plans, gonna tell you how he's gonna do, blah, you just paid them and you trust that he's gonna do job a good. The but you don't actually know what he's doing.

[Leonardo Cipriani]
And then let's say the next year you have another problem. And then another plumber comes. He goes, oh, this guy did this and this wrong. He wasn't supposed to do this. How many times have you heard this situation? Yeah, because you have no plan, so you just trust whatever the guy is telling you. But if you have plans, listen, I'm gonna get this line from here. I'm gonna remove from and I'm gonna do it this and this way. And here's your set of plans. So if you have any problems, you have a set of plans yourself, which is the owner of the house. and you can say, hey, plumber, my last plumber did this and this. Here it is. is like,

[Leonardo Cipriani]
It's not just any type of plumber. This guy now looks to be legit. So he can also charge more for his services. And that works with the plumber. It works with the landscape guy. We work with the electrical guy and everything But the way I see now, AI is doing all the work. But those labor things, the people know how to do but they are not very well structured.

[Leonardo Cipriani]
And that's where I think you guys can help them.

[Leonardo Cipriani]
Yeah, they don't do it. Again, it has to be vendors, people in general that wants to grow as a company, that wants to better, that wants to structure that. It has to be. They have to have it. If it's just, oh, I'm a plumber, it's just myself and all, then they're not gonna hire you.

[Leonardo Cipriani]
I think it's gonna be. It's a huge amount right now, and it's just gonna increase because more and more, let's say you're gonna work in a Building. If you're working on a building, you gotta have the license and then the building itself is gonna ask you for And if you don't have plans, what do you do? You subcontract someone that has a set of plans to sign the permits for you. So you need to have it.

[Leonardo Cipriani]
So it's a must, you Got it.

[Leonardo Cipriani]
There's a huge amount that doesn't have any shop joints. Then there is a big amount that's really actually trying to do shop joints, but that they are doing a shitty shop drawings and they would not need someone better to do for And then there's very few people like myself that they have shop drawings doing well right inside their company. Yeah, doing well inside their company.

[Leonardo Cipriani]
I would like to outsource a few things that I do here. For example, metal. Metal. I never wanted to get into metal. I just bought two machines to do metal myself because I can't find someone here in Florida that's doing metal that can give me a shop drawings of what they're doing. So I pay them and I hope that they're gonna do it right and they do it wrong and then it's on me and then I lose my money. So I'm trying to now have it inside my home so I can do it myself so I don't have to rely on no one. This would be a dream for me. Metal not related to you guys. Also the paint shop, I used to paint, outsource my paint. I paint myself here in my company.

[Leonardo Cipriani]
So I had to buy a machine that cost me almost $1 million to do it myself. In Italy, where those big guys are, they outsource everything here because I don't have the options to outsource I have to kind of do everything myself and it cost me a lot of money to do that.

[Leonardo Cipriani]
I'm good the way I am and I think it would be extremely hard to outsource those type of services in my.

[Leonardo Cipriani]
I'm a young guy just like you guys. I think I really wish you guys a lot of success, whatever you guys do. And consider Casa Petrus as one of your friends. You guys are here anytime you guys want. I'll send you some shop drawings now for you guys to take a look. And you guys gonna probably have more questions, just let me know. And I'm here to help you guys as much as I can.

[Leonardo Cipriani]
You guys take care. Bye. Bye.

[Leonardo Cipriani]
I was.
