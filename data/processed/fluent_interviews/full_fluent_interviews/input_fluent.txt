[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
There is something called shop drawings, which is a technical drawing thing. Yeah, right. That you need to have some technical knowledge. Of course. Yes. But this is something that I know in this industry from every part of the industry. Everybody's desperate for that. So because no one has a company here that they can rely on, they try to do And then whenever you're trying to do which is my case here, I have seven interior designs, designers and architects around the world working for me developing themselves to do that. It's not that they were meant to do that. They were interior designers or architects.

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
Because I paid them. Good. Because I paid them in dollars. They're working for me and they are doing. Not because they want to, they're just doing it for the money.

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
The thing is the designers and architects they have on this side of the. Is more like creativity, innovation, it has to look But our brain, we are not very. How can I explain that? Our brain doesn't really work like process, step by step, engineering, your guys So we fuck it up all the time.

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
so I'm saying that to you.

[Interviewer] Emilio Alvarez Flores
huh, why is that? Is it just the attention to detail versus artistic flair or.

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
No, just try to imagine yourself as a designer. So you're a designer, you need to think about colors matching this with that, blah, So your brain works more into this side of the job. But there's another side of which is the boring part, which is the technical part. But designers, they keep doing shit that doesn't work. So it works in their mind. Putting whenever you try to build something, it doesn't work. And I work with the best interior designers in Florida.

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
And they don't know. Whatever they're doing is completely wrong.

[Interviewer] Gabriel Almeida
Got you.

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
So they don't know.

[Interviewer] Gabriel Almeida
So let me.

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
So it's always a fight. go ahead.

[Interviewer] Gabriel Almeida
Yeah, let me.

[Interviewer] Gabriel Almeida
Sorry to interrupt you but just so we can follow you a little bit more. So you're saying that shops, for example, Lattice Shop, they're not capable of producing the technical drawings that you need for the shop drawings. why can't you rely on the drawings that affirm design solutions, for example, gives you. Why do you need to create your own.

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
Yeah, so they, what I do rely on them is the design. The design is how it looks. So they look that they want. Yes, they do. They do it. Wow. It's a wow job. But the way they think we're going to create that, it's wrong. So they think we're gonna build in a way, but this way that they think doesn't really work. So then we have to show them on my end, on my shop, say, listen, Ada, I know what you're trying to get, but this way you're thinking, we cannot build this way. We're gonna have to do it this way. But we're gonna get to where you want. But why do they got it?

[Interviewer] Emilio Alvarez Flores
And so why do they tell you, like, when they're sending their drawings? Why do they send you With the way that they think it should be built?

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
It's just I am a company, Casa Petrus, that I am and I have people here to do everything here myself. But they have nobody. So the designers try to tell them what they want because they don't really know what they're doing. So the designers try to tell the new worker what they should do, you know?

[Interviewer] Emilio Alvarez Flores
I see.

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
And that's why there's always a fighting between the designers and the mill workers. And when I say new workers, I'm also saying about any other vendors that can be the general contractor, that can be the floor guy, that can be the ceiling guy, whatever.

[Interviewer] Gabriel Almeida
Okay, got it.

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
Because the way you execute the work is going to affect the design, the way it looks. And that's why designers hate vendors and vendors hate designers.

[Interviewer] Gabriel Almeida
Yeah, that makes And then, Leonardo, when you say that, for example, when interior designer, like, design solutions suggests to mill workers, like, how to build it. Right. Not only what, but how. What does that mean when they tell you, like, how to do it? Is it like, the dimensions of things or, like, what are those instructions? What are the type of instructions, for example? Just so we can learn.

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
So I have. It depends on the level of company you're talking about. So Design Solutions, they are a great company. So they have great people working, they've been in business for a long time, so they are already more structured as a company. So they will send me a full ID set. The ID set has a render of how they want it to look, they have details of how they want it to be built, blah, blah, all the info. But most of the designers, you get a package that's just like a few renders from Pinterest, from Instagram, whatever. This is more or less what I was looking for. So you have those two worlds got it, like, in the designers and also in the vendors. So Me as a vendor now, I have shop drawings.

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
And what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna send you a ID package that I received from a designer and what I give it them when they sign a contract with me with all my shop joins. And sometimes they send me one page of a render and I send them back 20 pages of shop joints explaining to them detail by detail. So as soon as they sign, they know what they are getting in the end.

[Interviewer] Gabriel Almeida
Got it.

[Interviewer] Emilio Alvarez Flores
And quick question, and I assume the answer is but like, all of the work you do is custom, right?

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
all of the work that I do here is custom.

[Interviewer] Gabriel Almeida
And then Leonardo, you said basically that I heard in the audio that you sent a lot Right, we heard it three times, me and Emir. so you mentioned like, although you have this structure of designers working for And before I continue asking that question, they work part time for you only, right? Or they work full time for you.

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
No, full time.

[Interviewer] Gabriel Almeida
All of them work full time.

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
Working full time.

[Interviewer] Gabriel Almeida
And you said that like, you know, your shop drawings, you know, they could but you think they're pretty good for your scope of work and you've improved them a lot. So I was a bit surprised, man, when you said, like, since you already have all that network that's working apparently quite well for you, I was surprised when you said that if there was a company that could provide you with that quality of people, that you would prefer paying that company than having those employees yourself like you do today.

[Interviewer] Emilio Alvarez Flores
Why is that the case?

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
Because it cost me a lot of money. So I have seven people here to do shop drawings. I have 37 people in my company, seven of them. So like 20, 30% of my companies just to do stupid shop drawings. So designers can sign and I can build. So it's a lot of cost on my end. That's why other build workers and other vendors, they don't actually do shop drawings. They ask you to find the render and they build upon the render. And then sometimes the designers, whenever they are very happy and sometimes they're very pissed with those other brands. With me, that doesn't happen because I give them step by step how I'm gonna build. You guys gonna see my shop joins after they sign. If it's on my shop joints, my responsibility. If it's not, it's their responsibility.

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
But one thing is for sure, they are never surprised with my work because whatever I'm gonna cut before I cut. They already know what I'm doing. Those seven people that works for me, it's just to really make it a clear vision of the future so there is no miscommunication, blah, Nothing like that.

[Interviewer] Gabriel Almeida
But why, Why do you think it's gonna be cheaper if you pay a company to do it instead of having the employees yourself?

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
Because even though I have seven people here, they still make a lot of mistakes on my company. And when I say my company, man, I am not a small guy, but I'm not, like, the best huge guy as well. I still make mistakes. And I see the companies from Italy that have, like, 200 years old, they still make a lot of fucking mistakes. And that cost us a lot of money because I do custom. if I cut something wrong, it's not just the piece itself. I also lacquer. So I do lacquer on or I do wood on top. I do stain on top. So cutting wrong. And then I have another six, seven steps of the process that I'm working on a piece that is wrong from the beginning. And I didn't know. And I'm only gonna realize that when I'm installing.

[Interviewer] Gabriel Almeida
Got And that was because of mistakes in the sh. Shop drawings?

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
Yes. If it's wrong on the shop drawings, I'm gonna be 100 wrong until the end.

[Interviewer] Gabriel Almeida
so your assumption is that if there was a company that specialized in providing you labor for shop drawings specific to mill workers, that they would make less mistakes in the shop drawings than your guys currently do and therefore would end up costing you less.

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
Yes, I'm 100% on that. Maybe it wouldn't work now for me as Casa Pentos, because I have this whole structure here already to start working with a company like that. But 99% of the new workers, they don't have the instruction that I have. So they would be like, thank you, God, that you guys exist. They have no one now. They have zero people doing shop joins. And then you guys can come and give them this opportunity. They would love you. And the designers that work with them would also love them now for having shop joins, you know, so it's either like, you have zero shop or you have the kind of shop joins that I have.

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
You know, maybe I wouldn't work with you guys, but most of the vendors, yes, they would love you guys, because if you met me two years ago, I would have hired you. Gotcha.

[Interviewer] Emilio Alvarez Flores
Out of curiosity, how much do you pay your team?

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
Between two to $3,000 a month each Person, I have people in Europe, I have person a month. Yes. I have people here in Brazil, I have people in Spain, I have people in but they are designers and architects. So in Brazil that's 11, 12,000 reais a month. So that's. So it's a good salary for them. but if you have someone that is more like a junior or something that's working for you can pay a thousand bucks, eight hundred, twelve hundred dollars and they are happy with it.

[Interviewer] Gabriel Almeida
And you like, you intentionally went for the more experienced, more expensive guys.

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
Yeah, because what I do here in the beginning, it's also, I'm telling you guys the end of the story. But now I am where I am. But two years ago I didn't have that much money. I didn't have that much of access to all of that I have now. So in the beginning I was paying people $800 a month and then 1500 and then 2000, now up to 3000. Because I'm growing and I'm selling more and more expensive things. So now I have the possibility to do that. But it wasn't always like that.

[Interviewer] Gabriel Almeida
Got it.

[Interviewer] Gabriel Almeida
And then you said that maybe now or didn't say maybe, you said that probably now you wouldn't be a good fit to onboard a service with the one that we're thinking of building on our. So do you think that is for sure or is there a scenario in your head where you would be willing to try out little by little, substituting the current people you have for the service and what would it take if so.

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
No, no. Yes. I would definitely hire you guys for a few things because right now, even though I have those seven people, I still subcontract, John, sometimes with freelancers, architects, drawings people. So I still do that

[Interviewer] Emilio Alvarez Flores
How often does that How often does it happen?

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
Almost every month.

[Interviewer] Gabriel Almeida
So every month you need to hire extra hands, part time on a project basis. Maybe because the current people you have are not enough.

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
Yeah. Just so you know, for I work here with projects, more or less 500,000 and more. so I have 800,000 dollar project, 1 million, $1.2 million. So the amount of details in a shop joints that goes into a $1 million project, it's insane. Yeah, I'll send you guys some shop drawings. You guys will just be able to see it. So you have one room and this room has 36 pages. But the houses I do, they have six, seven rooms and then they have a Kitchen and they have 12 closets and then they have 18 bathrooms. So.

[Interviewer] Gabriel Almeida
So you only do someone.

[Interviewer] Gabriel Almeida
Yeah, sorry, go ahead.

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
So whenever I have these two girls working on this Fisher island project, I don't want them to stop just to do a wall unit for me here and there. I want them to finish the Fisher island project. I don't want them to be moving you know?

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
So sometimes I need to do one bathroom vanity or just one little closet here just to keep moving on another project, instead of me calling them, hey, stop, start doing this. I just subcontract someone. this is more like a simple job. This is what I need. do the shop drawings for me. That's the way we do it.

[Interviewer] Gabriel Almeida
And then how easy is it to find these extra temporary hands when you need them for the shop drawings or not? how good is it working? How easy is it to find those people? Where are they?

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
To be honest with you, it's a fucked up situation in the world right now. So if you have money, man, cash is king. It's not as easy for you to find someone that is reliable, that that the motherfucker is there working for you and he's not at the beach. That's the problem. But at the same time, they are everywhere in central South America, anywhere that the dollar is a strong money. They are everywhere. You know, for someone in Brazil to be seen at home working for a company in Miami making 12,000 reais a month, It's a lot of money for them.

[Interviewer] Gabriel Almeida
So just to understand, Leonardo, you seem to only do super high end luxury houses and apartments,

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
Yes, We, we catered the company like that. I started doing thirty thousand dollar projects and that was four years ago. And then I raised to 50, then to 70, then to 150, then to 200, 300. I still do two hundred thousand dollar project. Yes. It's not my average now it's between five to 600.

[Interviewer] Gabriel Almeida
Wow, that's amazing, man. Congrats.

[Interviewer] Emilio Alvarez Flores
How many projects do you have at a time?

[Interviewer] Emilio Alvarez Flores
How many concurrent projects do you usually have?

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
I can't hear you, man.

[Interviewer] Gabriel Almeida
how many, how many projects do you have at a time,

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
Oh, right Now I do four or five a month. Not that I'm cutting $2 million a month. I'm not able to do that. It's just that I'm finishing up maybe one or two projects from last month. And I'm also already start working on another two new projects.

[Interviewer] Gabriel Almeida
At the Same time. You work at most, in three projects at a time.

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
Or I have five staples, so I have five carpenters and every carpenter is working on something different.

[Interviewer] Gabriel Almeida
Okay, cool.

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
Sometimes we're doing three, four projects at a time. My dream is to raise my price tag to 7, 800,000 and be doing one or two houses a month. And my. That would be a dream. In the end of the year, I have worked with 20 clients or 30 clients at the most. That would be a dream for me.

[Interviewer] Gabriel Almeida
but let me. so here's what I'm confused about, Leonardo, because you said that you have five guys on the table, each of them working on something but you said that they do one to two projects a month. So when you say something different, it's something different for the same project.

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
Yeah. The company Casa Bedrooms work on two, three projects a month. But then I have and sometimes one. One is doing the bathroom, the other one is doing a closet, the other one is doing the kitchen for the same project. But then everyone is doing something different.

[Interviewer] Gabriel Almeida
Got it.

[Interviewer] Gabriel Almeida
That makes And then, Lorado, it seems and correct me if I'm but it seems like you're a niche, rare species in the mill worker universe, let's because you only do these, super high end.

[Interviewer] Gabriel Almeida
Projects. So like, when you think about, like, all new workers in the U.S. like, you're probably in what like, 5% that only does super expensive projects. Like, how would you distribute the universe of like, meal workers?

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
That's a good question. The way the designers see the world as a vendor is you have the Italian people, and they are very good, and they consider them the best.

[Interviewer] Gabriel Almeida
And they're all in Italy. They're all in Italy.

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
Most of them in my world, which is me, work carpentry. kitchens, closets. Yes. Italy.

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
Some of them in Brazil as well. So in the designers of mine, you have the good people, which is Italian and Brazilian and then you have the local people, which is like. That has a bad reputation to it. It's like Hialeah people.

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
The Hialeah people have no shop joints, have nothing. They're gonna do for fifth of the price. But you're gonna have to be dealing with the crazy carpenter with a big belly, you know? And that's, that's how it works. At the same time, brother, even though I'm doing this high, high end thing. Yes. The need in the United States for good Carpentry, good quality product, it's huge. So the designers, they hate to work with the Hialeah people. They don't understand design, they don't understand what it needs to be done. And the way I see the market here in America moving, it's moving towards custom, it's moving towards the good stuff. And that's why Casa Petrus has been so successful here. Because we are doing whatever they are doing in but we are doing your local.

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
So if you want to go as a shop, joins people to provide that kind of service, it's gonna, you guys gonna provide that service for the people that really want to grow towards the higher end market. Not to worse doing two three thousand dollar kitchen.

[Interviewer] Gabriel Almeida
Yeah. Let me ask you this Orlando, because our expectation actually was that there wasn't gonna be that much demand for custom stuff because most American customers are very price sensitive and they don't have a lot of money. So they're gonna try to go for things that are more set and cost less for their house. But what makes you think then that everyone is basically gonna start having a higher willingness to pay and going for more custom stuff.

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
If you take a look at the reports, everybody's spending more money now on their homes. Especially after pandemic, Americans kind of realize the need of spending more time in the comfort of their homes. So they're investing more in their homes and also the price tag of a house now they are way more money. So you're not going to hire anybody to do whatever job in your house that you're killing yourself to pay your mortgage. nice. This is the reports of people spending more and more money towards their homes. So demand has been huge, huge.

[Interviewer] Gabriel Almeida
Got it.

[Interviewer] Gabriel Almeida
Non stop interesting. And then one of the biggest questions we have, Leonardo, is if everyone in your ecosystem, right, mill workers, designers, everyone in the builders, are they gonna be more interested in hiring us for a full time, someone we put with them full time that they pay every month? Or you think they're gonna want the part time plug and play only when the house is on fire for them?

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
You know, I think they would have, they would love to have a kind of a partnership with you. Because if you guys start doing chop joints for casa bedrooms, you guys need to really understand the way I build things. So you guys have to kind of give me a customizable service to whatever the way I build things. Because there are many ways for you to build something and to get the same final results, it's just different ways to get there. So you guys need to understand the way I build so you guys can adapt your shop joint to. To my kind of you

[Interviewer] Gabriel Almeida
Yeah, that makes sense. But I'm thinking more like, how do you think they would want to, like, pay for us and for what type of work, Leonardo, would they want to pay for For us to staff someone full time with them? Just like you have your guys across the world or you think they'll be more interested you know?

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
No, I think. But this is me guessing, huh? If it was me, I would need you guys here every month. And I'll pay a subscription. I pay you, I don't know how much dollars per And you guys work with me for a period of time. Okay, Maybe we could. Maybe if I'm desperate, maybe we could do this for a period of three months, four months. But it's not something that you're gonna come in here one week, and then you are out of here. It doesn't really need to exchange a lot of you know?

[Interviewer] Emilio Alvarez Flores
Got But would you be willing to, engage in a 1, 2, 3 year

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
I would. Again today. I have the set of but if I didn't have these people, you guys have no idea how much I suffered trying to find someone in order to do that for us.

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
Like, I didn't have the money to hire people to do it for myself. So for me, it was cheaper just to pay a bill, to pay an invoice for someone that would do the job for me and that knew what they were doing.

[Interviewer] Gabriel Almeida
And, Leonardo, we're not trying to, like, sell you anything here in the spot. We're just doing research to understand, like, what it would take to be, like, successful in this business.

[Interviewer] Gabriel Almeida
But, if I approached you today and I'm like, listen, man, we have this very, like, differentiated way like, finding the best drawers in the world. And we have a very quick way for them to get up to speed with you. And if they. If you don't like them, we take care of all the recruiting and all the replacement. You don't have to, like, spend any time looking at this. Would you be willing to, like, swap out your worst drafter? Now? To try one guy with us. And depending how that goes, we continue swapping out more of your guys. Or you wouldn't. You wouldn't be willing to even try that because you're happy now with the structure that you have.

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
You asked me as any new worker or you asked me as a Casa Petros.

[Interviewer] Gabriel Almeida
Casa Petrus, man.

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
As Casa Petrus right now, I would give you the opportunity because I know you and And, yes, I will give you the opportunity. But right now, I already have a structure that works for me, those seven people, and I would hire you guys for the extra work that I have. I would start this way.

[Interviewer] Gabriel Almeida
Got it?

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
And then if you guys do it and then you guys will grow inside my company, you know?

[Interviewer] Gabriel Almeida
Got it.

[Interviewer] Gabriel Almeida
sense. That makes perfect sense.

[Interviewer] Emilio Alvarez Flores
And quick question, Leonardo. Like, in Florida, how many direct competitors do you think you have?

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
So that's why. That's exactly what I think. You guys are getting it and I might be wrong, And by the way, I want to invite you guys here. The doors are open.

[Interviewer] Gabriel Almeida
Thank you so much. That would be amazing.

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
You guys can have a. A better understanding of what I'm telling you guys. Whenever you guys come here, you see the way I do things here. You guys can understand who I am and where I and with all the humbleness in the world, I say that I'm a very young guy. I am nowhere close to everyone I get but at the same time, man, I'm already years ahead of 99% of the competition here.

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
So I think the approach you guys have, you wouldn't be to a company like myself. I think your first approach will be to a guy that he doesn't have shop drawings at all, so he has no one. And you guys would come and you guys would add something to his company that he can now offer to the designers. Understood. So I think this is the big, big market for you guys, you know? And whenever you guys get extremely good, like, wow, you have like, the best in the world, blah, And then you guys could come, a company Casa Petro, and say, listen, Casa Petro, stop wasting all of this money. To the seven people you pay. How much do you pay?

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
Listen, pay me this much, and I run this business for you and, like, risk free, and you don't have to worry about these people. And then I would say, it's yours, guys.

[Interviewer] Gabriel Almeida
And then. So how do these mill workers make money though? Not if they don't have anyone drafting for them to shop drawings. Like, how do they do it

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
Man, to be honest with you, I don't know either. It's crazy, man. They sell on the spot. So sometimes they sell a job, that $100,000 job, they think it's a lot of money. But in the end, he doesn't know if he's spending 60,000, 80,000, or if he's spending And he's losing Because whatever cost us a lot of money is 250,000.

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
How is this guy charging around 50? It's impossible, right?

[Interviewer] Gabriel Almeida
But then how did. How did you start then, Leonardo, before your people doing shop drawings for you? Like, how did you do it?

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
In the beginning, I always worked with the Steiner. So before having new work company, I had a stone company. So I was doing countertops And things like this. And they were always. The designers were always complaining about the millwork. So that's how I got into millwork. And I was the type of guy that, like, designer, I am here, Leo. Now I have a company, Casa Petros. I would like to do it good for you from anything, about carpentry. Just so you guys know, I don't know how to build any cabins, nothing like I'm a business guy that got into this because of a need.

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
And the way I discovered since the beginning was like, the problems that happens between designers and the mill workers because there is no shop drawings. No one had shop drawings. So when I started the company, I already started doing shop drawings. The first thing I did, I hired an architect from Brazil that was here in And I I need you to put shop drawings So whenever I build something, there's no surprise between the designer and me. So that's how we started. I started already with that, right?

[Interviewer] Gabriel Almeida
And then Leonardo, like, I obviously believe that you know, a lot that we don't know, man. But like, for you it seems very, you seem to be very confident that if we create this service, there's gonna be a lot of demand and a lot of business for us. But can you bring us more into your head as to why you think Because the way you're putting it now, you're saying a lot of these mean, Like, can you explain more?

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
Yeah, I get it. But the thing is, if you don't have shop drawings, you're not going to grow as a business towards a better quality product. So you're always going to be working as an amateur that sometimes people are going to get pissed with you and they just don't simply answer their phone anymore. And that's And this happens here every week with designers. You can ask a lot of vendors you hire, then you have a problem with them, they simply don't answer you anymore and they're gone. Those guys, I don't know, I don't have a solution for them. But if those guys, let's talk a different type of guy now. You are a small carpenter. You want to grow as a business, you must have some choice. It's not a question if you gotta have it.

[Interviewer] Gabriel Almeida
Interesting.

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
So in the only way for you to grow, you got. It's just like buying a car. You gotta have the.

[Interviewer] Gabriel Almeida
of yeah, you gotta have it.

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
There's no other way for you to get there without it. And most of the guys, they remain as their amateur because they don't know how to get to this, how to, how to grow.

[Interviewer] Gabriel Almeida
Right, how to grow.

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
Well, and it's just And they hate to work with designers. Why they hate designers so much? Because designers always want something to be very specific in this, this way. So they rather work with homeowners that if they do any fucked ups, whatever, they already got the money in advance and fuck the homeowner. That's how they do And designers, they don't do that because designer is a business gonna come back next week, it's gonna come back next month. And homeowners, you do it today and you never see the homeowner's face again.

[Interviewer] Gabriel Almeida
And how easy do you think, man, it's gonna be for us to convince these, because I understand what you're saying, right? You're saying basically, if the guy has ambition, if he wants to grow, then there's no option but for him to, like, create a structure that he has shop drawings created for him internally.

[Interviewer] Gabriel Almeida
But how easy do you think it's gonna be for us to, convince these guys like, basically change the way they do

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
Yeah. I think you're actually giving them something that they always wanted to have, but they don't have. So I don't think it's a. It's gonna be hard to convince them. What I think it's gonna be hard for you guys is to find the right people, the right drafters that they know what they are doing. As shop joins, I'm gonna send you guys the few options as soon as we're done. This call here, a few things for you guys to see. My shop joins, if you find the right drafters and then get this drafter to understand my company, Casa Petros, so they can build the way I want. And the next company they gonna.

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
You guys gonna hire or you guys gonna sell to, you guys also need to like, get this briefing from this other company how they build which is probably different than Casa matters.

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
So I think this is the. hard part for you guys, you know?

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
But convincing my carpenter that he needs shop drawings, it's. There's no convincing. They all know they need it.

[Interviewer] Gabriel Almeida
Okay, And then how hard was it for you, Leonardo, to find your people and to train them to your style?

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
So I have hired maybe 20, 22 people, and today I have seven people. So I keep changing them. Not that easy. But when I say not that easy, it's not about the technical part of it. It's more the personality, you know, the person. Because they're working from home, in a different country, in a different language. how it huh? I'm not there. I'm not controlling them. And I have changed here, not because of technical problems, but more of people problem, you know?

[Interviewer] Gabriel Almeida
So, so you're saying that you fired a lot of these people, right? You hired 20 but you only have which means that a lot of them quit or you fire them. And you're saying that it's not because they made mistakes in the drawings. It's because of, like, maybe you weren't convinced that they were working the whole day or like that.

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
Because sometimes I send you a bathroom and you take two days to get it and then I send it to another design drafter and they take a week. So I'm like, there's no way for you to take a week to do a bathroom. Yeah, it's impossible.

[Interviewer] Emilio Alvarez Flores
In question, like, because you mentioned that you pay people up to $3,000 a month right now, something like that.

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
If we, as a service, just so you know, only one person makes 3,000 here. Okay. She's very like. She's a senior. architect. She's the only one. The average is 2,000.

[Interviewer] Emilio Alvarez Flores
Okay, let's call it 2,000. If were to supply an office, insurance, benefits, those kinds of things, would you be willing to pay a premium? Because that may increase, like, how well they work.

[Interviewer] Gabriel Almeida
So the idea that we're having one of the ideas is like, we actually make an office, for example, in Brazil, right. And then we give them benefits. We're basically your human resources department overseas, right. We keep track if they're in the office or not. When they want to take vacation, we do that intermediation between them But they work only for you.

[Interviewer] Gabriel Almeida
Like, would you pay a premium for that type of Or you would prefer to pay And us being like a fully remote company, each person working from their own house, for example.

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
I would pay less.

[Interviewer] Gabriel Almeida
You would prefer to pay less if.

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
You'Re working from home or working from an office? Doesn't really change nothing for me. What really changes for me is your delivery time. So that you have. That's your problem, with your people, you gotta make them work. And I want to pay more money because you guys have an office, though.

[Interviewer] Gabriel Almeida
Got it.

[Interviewer] Emilio Alvarez Flores
Even if that's a way to ensure the delivery.

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
I'm saying on my end, as a client. Yeah. If you guys in the end are gonna need to do that, it's another thing. But as a client, I wouldn't. mind if they're working from home or in office.

[Interviewer] Gabriel Almeida
Interesting. Like, you wouldn't. Okay, interesting. You're like, indifferent basically, right?

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
And one thing that's very important to mention, I always have projects here, so I keep my people busy. And I have other drafters that sometimes they call me, Leo, do you have a job for me? I say, what's wrong with your job? He goes, leo, sometimes I have a lot of work in one Month because the company sold a lot of projects. But then next month they go, oh, I'm slow, I don't have any projects for you to draft. And they fire them or they don't pay them or whatever, So if I had you guys, I only pay. I have a project with you.

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
If I don't have any products, I pay you guys nothing.

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
So it's also a risk on my end as well.

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
And sometimes I always have but sometimes I'm a little slow. And they are doing one bathroom vanity. They are working on a slow motion version of it. Let's, let's put it this way. So it cost me money to.

[Interviewer] Emilio Alvarez Flores
So to confirm, right? you would not be willing. Let me see if I'm hearing you right. you would not be willing to. You would not be willing to have a monthly subscription that is independent of the amount of work that you have.

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
Right now with the structure. I have. No.

[Interviewer] Gabriel Almeida
because you already have those people.

[Interviewer] Gabriel Almeida
Got it.

[Interviewer] Gabriel Almeida
And if you didn't have these people, then you would want to pay us monthly.

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
Yes, I would.

[Interviewer] Gabriel Almeida
Got it. Got it.

[Interviewer] Gabriel Almeida
And then, when you think about just your business in total, Is there like. So we're trying to understand because we're looking at the ecosystem of new workers, architecture designers, and we're trying to understand what should we offer outsourcing for?

[Interviewer] Gabriel Almeida
Do you think that the most obvious need is drafting shop drawings or is it, for example, sales so you can have more project. Right. And we do sales for you, or something else, like remote personal assistance or marketing. Like, do you think that drafting and shop drawings is going to be by far the biggest need and most urgent need or.

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
Whatever? It's best. I don't know. But the one that has the most need is shop joints And not just with mill workers. That works with plumbing company with electrical, plumbing with gcs, with landscape company with everything.

[Interviewer] Gabriel Almeida
Can you tell us more about that, Leonardo? So why does like plumbing, electrical and landscaping have to do shop drawings all the time?

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
Just try to imagine that you had a problem in your house and you're gonna call a plumber. Do you think he's gonna come with you with a set of plans, gonna tell you how he's gonna do, blah, you just paid them and you trust that he's gonna do job a good. The job, but you don't actually know what he's doing.

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
And then let's say the next year you have another problem. And then another plumber comes. He goes, this guy did this and this wrong. He wasn't supposed to do this. How many times have you heard this situation? Yeah, because you have no plan, so you just trust whatever the guy is telling you. But if you have plans, listen, I'm gonna get this line from here. I'm gonna remove from and I'm gonna do it this and this is like, wow.

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
it's not just any type of plumber. This guy now looks to be legit. So he can also charge more for his services. And that works with the plumber. It works with the landscape guy. We work with the electrical guy and everything But the way I see now, AI is doing all the work. But those labor things, the people know how to do but they are not very well structured.

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
And that's where I think you guys can help them.

[Interviewer] Gabriel Almeida
But.

[Interviewer] Gabriel Almeida
But then again, and I'm not saying you're wrong, Right. I believe you are probably right. But then you're saying that the plumbers and the landscapers, they would have to change the way they work for them to want our service. Because it's not. It's not what they do today. Right. They don't do shop drawings today.

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
Yeah, they don't do it. Again, it has to be vendors, people in general that wants to grow as a company, that wants to better, that wants to structure that. It has to be. They have to have it. If it's just, oh, I'm a plumber, it's just myself and all, everybody, then they're not gonna hire you.

[Interviewer] Gabriel Almeida
Right. Got it.

[Interviewer] Gabriel Almeida
And how many people do you think are already like that, Leonardo? Do you think there's a good amount of people that are already in that level of or you think there's almost no one?

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
I think it's gonna be. It's a huge amount right now, and it's just gonna increase because more and more, let's say you're gonna work in a Building. If you're working on a building, you gotta have the license and then the building itself is gonna ask you for And if you don't have plans, what do you do? You subcontract someone that has a set of plans to sign the permits for you. So you need to have it.

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
So it's just it's a must, you Got it.

[Interviewer] Gabriel Almeida
And you think there's a good amount of mill workers in Florida, for example, in the U.S. leonardo, that already have the level of sophistication. Well, not maybe your but that already do shop drawings Do you think there's a good amount of them or very few?

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
There's a huge amount that doesn't have any shop joints. Then there is a big amount that's really actually trying to do shop joints, but that they are doing a shitty shop drawings and they would not need someone better to do for And then there's very few people like myself that they have shop drawings doing well right inside their company. Yeah, doing well inside their company.

[Interviewer] Gabriel Almeida
Got it.

[Interviewer] Gabriel Almeida
And then for you as a company today, Leonardo, I understand that obviously the shop drawings is like something they already have figured out you would be interested potentially in, trying as part time when everything is on fire, have too many projects. But is there anything else in your company today that you would like to outsource, even outside of shop drawings or you're good?

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
I would like to outsource a few things that I do here. For example, metal. Metal. I never wanted to get into metal. Now I just bought two machines to do metal myself because I can't find someone here in Florida that's doing metal that can give me a shop drawings of what they're doing. So I pay them and I hope that they're gonna do it right so I can do it myself so I don't have to rely on no one. This would be a dream for me. Metal not related to you guys. Also the paint shop, I used to paint, outsource my paint. I paint myself here in my company.

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
So I had to buy a machine that cost me almost $1 million to do it myself. In Italy, where those big guys are, they outsource everything here because I don't have the options to outsource I have to kind of do everything myself and it cost me a lot of money to do that.

[Interviewer] Gabriel Almeida
Interesting. but you're talking more you know, like, you know, on job site, painting, metal production, things like that. What about more administrative things on Aldo, accounting, sales, marketing, a personal remote assistant. what about those things? Do you have any interest to outsource those or. You're good the way you are, man.

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
I'm good the way I am and I think it would be extremely hard to outsource those type of services in my.

[Interviewer] Gabriel Almeida
Interesting, interesting.

[Interviewer] Gabriel Almeida
Got it.

[Interviewer] Gabriel Almeida
Super good. Leonardo, thank you so much for your time and thank you for your generosity. Sorry for going over time here. I know how busy you but we've learned a ton. A ton.

[Interviewer] Emilio Alvarez Flores
Appreciate it.

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
I'm a young guy just like you guys. I think I really wish you guys a lot of success, whatever you guys do. And please consider Casa Petrus as one of your friends. You guys are here anytime you guys want. I'll send you some shop drawings now for you guys to take a look. And you guys gonna probably have more questions, just let me know. And I'm here to help you guys as much as I can.

[Interviewer] Emilio Alvarez Flores
Amazing.

[Interviewer] Gabriel Almeida
Thank you so much. Have a great week, man. We appreciate you. Take care.

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
All right, man. You guys take care. Bye. Bye.

[Interviewer] Gabriel Almeida
Bye.

[Interviewer] Gabriel Almeida
Cool guy,

[Interviewer] Gabriel Almeida
Interesting. Fucking crazy, this guy, Had no background in this shit and he was built a company out of it with no expertise.

[Interviewer] Emilio Alvarez Flores
I'm like.

[Interviewee] Leonardo Cipriani
I was.

[Interviewer] Emilio Alvarez Flores
Maybe it's because I've never, like. I don't disagree that shop drawings are but when I started going on the tangent on plumbers and stuff, like, that's never gonna happen, dude.

[Interviewer] Gabriel Almeida
He always depends on the plumber, man. It's what he said. If you're talking about the one motherfucker that's barely making ends meet and he does one plumbing job per time and he's a one man shop. but if you get a plumber that has ambition, that's young, a small plumbing company, not a plumber, then we're already talking. It doesn't have to be a massive plumbing company that does site four. It just has to be a professional plumbing company that isn't just one plumber.

[Interviewer] Emilio Alvarez Flores
But I worry, if you listen to the value prop that he said, the value proposal to the customer.

[Interviewer] Gabriel Almeida
No, it's the plumber.

[Interviewer] Gabriel Almeida
Because he said it's not going to make a mistake. It's the quality control. It's like, listen, man, here's the drawing of exactly what I'm going to do. And I'm going to give you this so you can have for your documentation as well in case there's any problem of exactly what I did, exactly what is done. It's a way less risky service for the customer and a much stronger value prop on the side. I'm not only giving you a service, I'm giving you documentation of the work that was done so you can keep it in your house if something goes wrong, one you can hold me accountable because you're like, what the went wrong. You promised me exactly this. Why didn't it work? And if I have a problem in the future, I know exactly what was changed and what was done.

[Interviewer] Emilio Alvarez Flores
I hear you. I.

[Interviewer] Gabriel Almeida
The thing is I feel like man, and I have this bias too. We need to stop thinking as these companies, as these guys, as these one man shops that the media illustrates. When we think plumber, when we think meal worker, we think a fucked up guy, man, that's poor and barely making ends meet. But there's small professional company. This guy's too good already. This guy's making money, bro. There's small companies that are still humble, but there are proper companies that do this.

[Interviewer] Emilio Alvarez Flores
Wait, here's the part where I worry.

[Interviewer] Gabriel Almeida
bro, I forgot to stop the power plant.

[Interviewer] Gabriel Almeida
Stop it.
