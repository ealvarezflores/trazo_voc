[Emilio Alvarez Flores]
It. Hide how? Hide this. Don't watch. Interesting. But yeah, man, that's basically some of the context. Can you like. And the reason, the way that I'm running this, right. It's like, it's super broad because, like, I don't want to bias you or anything.

[Emilio Alvarez Flores]
Then where we're thinking and so like, can you just tell me a bit more about how the process works from end to from the conception of an architecture project all the way to delivering it to the final client? I mean, actually, before that, can you tell me a bit more about the size type of

[Emilio Alvarez Flores]
What was the stadium?

[Emilio Alvarez Flores]
Did you get to know?

[Emilio Alvarez Flores]
Gotcha.

[Emilio Alvarez Flores]
Design development, but then not win another round.

[Emilio Alvarez Flores]
Makes sense. Overhead and switching and all that stuff.

[Emilio Alvarez Flores]
Got it. Okay.

[Emilio Alvarez Flores]
Construction, how big are these projects more or less in.

[Emilio Alvarez Flores]
In. revenue for the firm or the total construction?

[Emilio Alvarez Flores]
Okay, got it.

[Emilio Alvarez Flores]
Gotcha.

[Emilio Alvarez Flores]
And so when. And when it comes I mean. I mean, I imagine that changes but like, for the bottom two. Right. Like, act like con. Like, let's just call it construction or construction scale or something like that versus And then also homes probably, small commercial is probably similar. Right. Or is that more like the construction?

[Emilio Alvarez Flores]
But what like, a small office building or something like

[Emilio Alvarez Flores]
Got it. And so can you And there's like, obviously a difference between the 2D 3D drawings. And there's always a back and forth, right?

[Emilio Alvarez Flores]
Got it.

[Emilio Alvarez Flores]
Yeah. 80, 20,

[Emilio Alvarez Flores]
Gotcha. And then when it comes like, the. The way that different folks imagine there's a lot of back and forth and everything here. Like, how did I currently work? Is that going well? Are they. Are there things that could be done better.

[Emilio Alvarez Flores]
Gotcha. And And do you feel like the, like, this kind of working is working well or are there issues with it, especially for the smaller firms?

[Emilio Alvarez Flores]
So.

[Emilio Alvarez Flores]
And then now when you start thinking about the different functions and sub functions that firms consider core versus things that they might want to like, reduce costs for outsourcing, can you help me better understand from your perspective how to firms typically think about these things? What makes more or less sense?

[Emilio Alvarez Flores]
Yeah. Via outsourcing.

[Emilio Alvarez Flores]
Got and at what scale of a company does it make sense for you to have someone full time doing renders? And renders and also schematics.

[Emilio Alvarez Flores]
And what about with the 2D drawings or not?

[Emilio Alvarez Flores]
Gotcha. Because, like, for example, I've been speaking with interior design firms and they outsource that. But I think it has to do with their core capability. Like, they need that to do their work. But for them, it's like a look and feel that matters.

[Emilio Alvarez Flores]
Got it. Okay, And are there other functions like accounting, sales, anything along those lines where you think it would make sense to have external support?

[Emilio Alvarez Flores]
I And, if you were outsourcing or actually better question, did when you worked in the firms that you worked in, did you guys outsource actively or not so much?

[Emilio Alvarez Flores]
Got it. And then when you did like, did you do it offshore so there's a lot india and Singapore for or did you do somewhere else?

[Emilio Alvarez Flores]
Got it. Okay. And like, do you think it's because I can make two arguments. one argument is in it.

[Emilio Alvarez Flores]
Better to send it to for so that by the time you wake up, it's ready. Maybe just two times. Assuming there's another where I'm like, you probably want to be able to collaborate with these people.

[Emilio Alvarez Flores]
Maybe the time difference is actually kind of a barrier. Like. Yeah. Can you help me think through where you. What do you think?

[Emilio Alvarez Flores]
And where do you think most firms end up falling?

[Emilio Alvarez Flores]
Got it. And probably in there the time zone might make a difference because then you can give them a call and slowly but surely understand what they mean. All those things.

[Emilio Alvarez Flores]
Yeah, got it. Okay, that makes sense. And then I think, is there anything that I'm missing, man? if you were mean, like, you're thinking of like, I'm currently in the exploratory phase. Right. Is there anything in the way that I'm thinking about this and I'm missing like, how architecture firms, interior designers, all these guys think connect with each other.

[Emilio Alvarez Flores]
Yeah, so like, part of the context is like, from what I've heard is like, there's one. A lack of talent in the US to like, the turnover. Super high for architecture. Yeah, I mean, architecture, like, then just in like, design work, including And those things just like, lead to a lot of operational problems. Like, if you're an architect or interior designer, the last thing you want to do is like, you have a project, you're like, man, now I need to go recruit. Like, hold on to do that. Yeah, right.

[Emilio Alvarez Flores]
And then there's an opportunity here to create like, economic mobility in Latin America because there is a lot of great talent where like, again, you're on the same time zone, all these kinds of like, you can provide savings while at the same time actually providing higher salaries to folks in Latam.

[Emilio Alvarez Flores]
That's what I'm figuring out. There's like, part that like, it can be two 2D and 3D rendering, like some folks want, some of the smaller people want, like business consulting. I'm personally skeptical of it making sense because like, those. These firms are too small for my billable to make any sense.

[Emilio Alvarez Flores]
And so, and for it would have to be in the same time zone, like, be able to, like, get on the phone, all those kinds of things.

[Emilio Alvarez Flores]
Gotcha. Yeah, that makes And hey, as I can continue, like, exploring here, do you, like, have any other friends who might be willing to, like, spend 20, 30 minutes with

[Emilio Alvarez Flores]
Yeah, that'd be fantastic if they're still working. That'd be amazing.

[Emilio Alvarez Flores]
Thank you. You're the best. But yeah, man, I want to see you guys. Hopefully sometime over the summer.

[Emilio Alvarez Flores]
Weren't able to come to Mexico

[Emilio Alvarez Flores]
Yeah, it was super nice. Yeah.

[Emilio Alvarez Flores]
I'm not sure. I'm probably some point. I mean, this year I want to go. But dude, it's. This one has been insane with Delta V. Like.

[Emilio Alvarez Flores]
I've been. I mean, struggle much. That's part of what. It's what I signed up for. It's like working a short day is 11 hours.

[Emilio Alvarez Flores]
Still gonna go monetize them in one way or But I do feel like thesis is but the market isn't ready. It's kind of like the vibe I'm getting.

[Emilio Alvarez Flores]
Yeah, so for this idea, I'm working with another mba. I don't know if you know, you may know him. Gabe.

[Emilio Alvarez Flores]
Yeah, he's Brazilian. Yeah.

[Emilio Alvarez Flores]
BPO in general. But that's a candidate. So part of our candidates is essentially we're looking for things that are unlikely to be taken over by AI, where there's high attrition in the function, where there's a talent gap. they the firms literally cannot have find enough talent because then it makes all the sense in the world. At least there's always details. But. Yeah. Okay.

[Emilio Alvarez Flores]
Amazing, And. thanks for spending some time speaking with me on the weekend. Appreciate it.

[Emilio Alvarez Flores]
Appreciate it.

[Emilio Alvarez Flores]
Talk soon.

[Emilio Alvarez Flores]
