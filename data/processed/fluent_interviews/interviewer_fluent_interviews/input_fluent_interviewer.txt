[Emilio Alvarez Flores]
huh, why is that? Is it just the attention to detail versus artistic flair or.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Got you.

[Gabriel Almeida]
So let me.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Yeah, let me.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Sorry to interrupt you but just so we can follow you a little bit more. So you're saying that shops, for example, Lattice Shop, they're not capable of producing the technical drawings that you need for the shop drawings. why can't you rely on the drawings that affirm design solutions, for example, gives you. Why do you need to create your own.

[Emilio Alvarez Flores]
And so why do they tell you, like, when they're sending their drawings? Why do they send you With the way that they think it should be built?

[Emilio Alvarez Flores]
I see.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Okay, got it.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Yeah, that makes And then, Leonardo, when you say that, for example, when interior designer, like, design solutions suggests to mill workers, like, how to build it. Right. Not only what, but how. What does that mean when they tell you, like, how to do it? Is it like, the dimensions of things or, like, what are those instructions? What are the type of instructions, for example? Just so we can learn.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Got it.

[Emilio Alvarez Flores]
And quick question, and I assume the answer is but like, all of the work you do is custom, right?

[Gabriel Almeida]
And then Leonardo, you said basically that I heard in the audio that you sent a lot Right, we heard it three times, me and Emir. so you mentioned like, although you have this structure of designers working for And before I continue asking that question, they work part time for you only, right? Or they work full time for you.

[Gabriel Almeida]
All of them work full time.

[Gabriel Almeida]
And you said that like, you know, your shop drawings, you know, they could but you think they're pretty good for your scope of work and you've improved them a lot. So I was a bit surprised, man, when you said, like, since you already have all that network that's working apparently quite well for you, I was surprised when you said that if there was a company that could provide you with that quality of people, that you would prefer paying that company than having those employees yourself like you do today.

[Emilio Alvarez Flores]
Why is that the case?

[Gabriel Almeida]
But why, Why do you think it's gonna be cheaper if you pay a company to do it instead of having the employees yourself?

[Gabriel Almeida]
Got And that was because of mistakes in the sh. Shop drawings?

[Gabriel Almeida]
so your assumption is that if there was a company that specialized in providing you labor for shop drawings specific to mill workers, that they would make less mistakes in the shop drawings than your guys currently do and therefore would end up costing you less.

[Emilio Alvarez Flores]
Out of curiosity, how much do you pay your team?

[Gabriel Almeida]
And you like, you intentionally went for the more experienced, more expensive guys.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Got it.

[Gabriel Almeida]
And then you said that maybe now or didn't say maybe, you said that probably now you wouldn't be a good fit to onboard a service with the one that we're thinking of building on our. So do you think that is for sure or is there a scenario in your head where you would be willing to try out little by little, substituting the current people you have for the service and what would it take if so.

[Emilio Alvarez Flores]
How often does that How often does it happen?

[Gabriel Almeida]
So every month you need to hire extra hands, part time on a project basis. Maybe because the current people you have are not enough.

[Gabriel Almeida]
So you only do someone.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Yeah, sorry, go ahead.

[Gabriel Almeida]
And then how easy is it to find these extra temporary hands when you need them for the shop drawings or not? how good is it working? How easy is it to find those people? Where are they?

[Gabriel Almeida]
So just to understand, Leonardo, you seem to only do super high end luxury houses and apartments,

[Gabriel Almeida]
Wow, that's amazing, man. Congrats.

[Emilio Alvarez Flores]
How many projects do you have at a time?

[Emilio Alvarez Flores]
How many concurrent projects do you usually have?

[Gabriel Almeida]
how many, how many projects do you have at a time,

[Gabriel Almeida]
At the Same time. You work at most, in three projects at a time.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Okay, cool.

[Gabriel Almeida]
but let me. so here's what I'm confused about, Leonardo, because you said that you have five guys on the table, each of them working on something but you said that they do one to two projects a month. So when you say something different, it's something different for the same project.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Got it.

[Gabriel Almeida]
That makes And then, Lorado, it seems and correct me if I'm but it seems like you're a niche, rare species in the mill worker universe, let's because you only do these, super high end.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Projects. So like, when you think about, like, all new workers in the U.S. like, you're probably in what like, 5% that only does super expensive projects. Like, how would you distribute the universe of like, meal workers?

[Gabriel Almeida]
And they're all in Italy. They're all in Italy.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Yeah. Let me ask you this Orlando, because our expectation actually was that there wasn't gonna be that much demand for custom stuff because most American customers are very price sensitive and they don't have a lot of money. So they're gonna try to go for things that are more set and cost less for their house. But what makes you think then that everyone is basically gonna start having a higher willingness to pay and going for more custom stuff.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Got it.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Non stop interesting. And then one of the biggest questions we have, Leonardo, is if everyone in your ecosystem, right, mill workers, designers, everyone in the builders, are they gonna be more interested in hiring us for a full time, someone we put with them full time that they pay every month? Or you think they're gonna want the part time plug and play only when the house is on fire for them?

[Gabriel Almeida]
Yeah, that makes sense. But I'm thinking more like, how do you think they would want to, like, pay for us and for what type of work, Leonardo, would they want to pay for For us to staff someone full time with them? Just like you have your guys across the world or you think they'll be more interested you know?

[Emilio Alvarez Flores]
Got But would you be willing to, engage in a 1, 2, 3 year

[Gabriel Almeida]
And, Leonardo, we're not trying to, like, sell you anything here in the spot. We're just doing research to understand, like, what it would take to be, like, successful in this business.

[Gabriel Almeida]
But, if I approached you today and I'm like, listen, man, we have this very, like, differentiated way like, finding the best drawers in the world. And we have a very quick way for them to get up to speed with you. And if they. If you don't like them, we take care of all the recruiting and all the replacement. You don't have to, like, spend any time looking at this. Would you be willing to, like, swap out your worst drafter? Now? To try one guy with us. And depending how that goes, we continue swapping out more of your guys. Or you wouldn't. You wouldn't be willing to even try that because you're happy now with the structure that you have.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Casa Petrus, man.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Got it?

[Gabriel Almeida]
Got it.

[Gabriel Almeida]
sense. That makes perfect sense.

[Emilio Alvarez Flores]
And quick question, Leonardo. Like, in Florida, how many direct competitors do you think you have?

[Gabriel Almeida]
Thank you so much. That would be amazing.

[Gabriel Almeida]
And then. So how do these mill workers make money though? Not if they don't have anyone drafting for them to shop drawings. Like, how do they do it

[Gabriel Almeida]
But then how did. How did you start then, Leonardo, before your people doing shop drawings for you? Like, how did you do it?

[Gabriel Almeida]
And then Leonardo, like, I obviously believe that you know, a lot that we don't know, man. But like, for you it seems very, you seem to be very confident that if we create this service, there's gonna be a lot of demand and a lot of business for us. But can you bring us more into your head as to why you think Because the way you're putting it now, you're saying a lot of these mean, Like, can you explain more?

[Gabriel Almeida]
Interesting.

[Gabriel Almeida]
of yeah, you gotta have it.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Right, how to grow.

[Gabriel Almeida]
And how easy do you think, man, it's gonna be for us to convince these, because I understand what you're saying, right? You're saying basically, if the guy has ambition, if he wants to grow, then there's no option but for him to, like, create a structure that he has shop drawings created for him internally.

[Gabriel Almeida]
But how easy do you think it's gonna be for us to, convince these guys like, basically change the way they do

[Gabriel Almeida]
Okay, And then how hard was it for you, Leonardo, to find your people and to train them to your style?

[Gabriel Almeida]
So, so you're saying that you fired a lot of these people, right? You hired 20 but you only have which means that a lot of them quit or you fire them. And you're saying that it's not because they made mistakes in the drawings. It's because of, like, maybe you weren't convinced that they were working the whole day or like that.

[Emilio Alvarez Flores]
In question, like, because you mentioned that you pay people up to $3,000 a month right now, something like that.

[Emilio Alvarez Flores]
Okay, let's call it 2,000. If were to supply an office, insurance, benefits, those kinds of things, would you be willing to pay a premium? Because that may increase, like, how well they work.

[Gabriel Almeida]
So the idea that we're having one of the ideas is like, we actually make an office, for example, in Brazil, right. And then we give them benefits. We're basically your human resources department overseas, right. We keep track if they're in the office or not. When they want to take vacation, we do that intermediation between them But they work only for you.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Like, would you pay a premium for that type of Or you would prefer to pay And us being like a fully remote company, each person working from their own house, for example.

[Gabriel Almeida]
You would prefer to pay less if.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Got it.

[Emilio Alvarez Flores]
Even if that's a way to ensure the delivery.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Interesting. Like, you wouldn't. Okay, interesting. You're like, indifferent basically, right?

[Emilio Alvarez Flores]
So to confirm, right? you would not be willing. Let me see if I'm hearing you right. you would not be willing to. You would not be willing to have a monthly subscription that is independent of the amount of work that you have.

[Gabriel Almeida]
because you already have those people.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Got it.

[Gabriel Almeida]
And if you didn't have these people, then you would want to pay us monthly.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Got it. Got it.

[Gabriel Almeida]
And then, when you think about just your business in total, Is there like. So we're trying to understand because we're looking at the ecosystem of new workers, architecture designers, and we're trying to understand what should we offer outsourcing for?

[Gabriel Almeida]
Do you think that the most obvious need is drafting shop drawings or is it, for example, sales so you can have more project. Right. And we do sales for you, or something else, like remote personal assistance or marketing. Like, do you think that drafting and shop drawings is going to be by far the biggest need and most urgent need or.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Can you tell us more about that, Leonardo? So why does like plumbing, electrical and landscaping have to do shop drawings all the time?

[Gabriel Almeida]
But.

[Gabriel Almeida]
But then again, and I'm not saying you're wrong, Right. I believe you are probably right. But then you're saying that the plumbers and the landscapers, they would have to change the way they work for them to want our service. Because it's not. It's not what they do today. Right. They don't do shop drawings today.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Right. Got it.

[Gabriel Almeida]
And how many people do you think are already like that, Leonardo? Do you think there's a good amount of people that are already in that level of or you think there's almost no one?

[Gabriel Almeida]
And you think there's a good amount of mill workers in Florida, for example, in the U.S. leonardo, that already have the level of sophistication. Well, not maybe your but that already do shop drawings Do you think there's a good amount of them or very few?

[Gabriel Almeida]
Got it.

[Gabriel Almeida]
And then for you as a company today, Leonardo, I understand that obviously the shop drawings is like something they already have figured out you would be interested potentially in, trying as part time when everything is on fire, have too many projects. But is there anything else in your company today that you would like to outsource, even outside of shop drawings or you're good?

[Gabriel Almeida]
Interesting. but you're talking more you know, like, you know, on job site, painting, metal production, things like that. What about more administrative things on Aldo, accounting, sales, marketing, a personal remote assistant. what about those things? Do you have any interest to outsource those or. You're good the way you are, man.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Interesting, interesting.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Got it.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Super good. Leonardo, thank you so much for your time and thank you for your generosity. Sorry for going over time here. I know how busy you but we've learned a ton. A ton.

[Emilio Alvarez Flores]
Appreciate it.

[Emilio Alvarez Flores]
Amazing.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Thank you so much. Have a great week, man. We appreciate you. Take care.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Bye.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Cool guy,

[Gabriel Almeida]
Interesting. Fucking crazy, this guy, Had no background in this shit and he was built a company out of it with no expertise.

[Emilio Alvarez Flores]
I'm like.

[Emilio Alvarez Flores]
Maybe it's because I've never, like. I don't disagree that shop drawings are but when I started going on the tangent on plumbers and stuff, like, that's never gonna happen, dude.

[Gabriel Almeida]
He always depends on the plumber, man. It's what he said. If you're talking about the one motherfucker that's barely making ends meet and he does one plumbing job per time and he's a one man shop. but if you get a plumber that has ambition, that's young, a small plumbing company, not a plumber, then we're already talking. It doesn't have to be a massive plumbing company that does site four. It just has to be a professional plumbing company that isn't just one plumber.

[Emilio Alvarez Flores]
But I worry, if you listen to the value prop that he said, the value proposal to the customer.

[Gabriel Almeida]
No, it's the plumber.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Because he said it's not going to make a mistake. It's the quality control. It's like, listen, man, here's the drawing of exactly what I'm going to do. And I'm going to give you this so you can have for your documentation as well in case there's any problem of exactly what I did, exactly what is done. It's a way less risky service for the customer and a much stronger value prop on the side. I'm not only giving you a service, I'm giving you documentation of the work that was done so you can keep it in your house if something goes wrong, one you can hold me accountable because you're like, what the went wrong. You promised me exactly this. Why didn't it work? And if I have a problem in the future, I know exactly what was changed and what was done.

[Emilio Alvarez Flores]
I hear you. I.

[Gabriel Almeida]
The thing is I feel like man, and I have this bias too. We need to stop thinking as these companies, as these guys, as these one man shops that the media illustrates. When we think plumber, when we think meal worker, we think a fucked up guy, man, that's poor and barely making ends meet. But there's small professional company. This guy's too good already. This guy's making money, bro. There's small companies that are still humble, but there are proper companies that do this.

[Emilio Alvarez Flores]
Wait, here's the part where I worry.

[Gabriel Almeida]
bro, I forgot to stop the power plant.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Stop it.
