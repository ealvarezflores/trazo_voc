[Emilio Alvarez]
Hey, Maya.

[Emilio Alvarez]
Well, sorry, I'm like. I was trying to find what you call it a meeting room. They're all so I'm grab the standing desk.

[Emilio Alvarez]
Are.

[Emilio Alvarez]
How's your week going so far?

[Emilio Alvarez]
Of course. Where were you off to?

[Emilio Alvarez]
Oh, nice. I'm from. I'm from Mexico.

[Emilio Alvarez]
I'm from Mexico City.

[Emilio Alvarez]
Yeah, you should go if you go to Tulum. Are you. Yeah, there's definitely go. There's a place called. Where you can go swimming with the turtles nearby.

[Emilio Alvarez]
No, it's it's in the water, but it's crazy. You walk 10 yards and the turtles are there. I'm putting it in the chat.

[Emilio Alvarez]
That's really cool. It's real secret if you're interested. What else would I recommend that you might not know? but general, what I also recommend food wise, if you like spicy food, get. Get something called an aguachile, but it literally. translates to chili water.

[Emilio Alvarez]
No, no, our Chile, it's like. It's a little bit like. Like a but spicier.

[Emilio Alvarez]
Okay, hold on. Is this any better?

[Gabriel Almeida]
Is mine low

[Gabriel Almeida]
Right. Nice to meet you. Sorry I joined late a bit there.

[Emilio Alvarez]
Yeah, so we're just to give you some context. Maya, thanks for joining again. So Gabe and I, we just graduated from mit. We are part of an accelerator that's called Delta V. And the idea here is to basically take a lot of the things that you learn, especially around innovation, launching new companies, etcetera into And right now we're in the phase as we have some ideas on things that could be of value to folks like yourself, interior design. But we really want to pressure test and make sure that we're actually addressing something that would make a difference in your daily life. So to give you a bit of context, that's where we've narrowed in.

[Emilio Alvarez]
We're seeing some themes, but the way that we want to do this is we want to first ask you some questions to better understand what pain, what things you might be, what is going well, what challenges you might have. And then from there we'd like, towards the end, show you us a super early version of what we're thinking might be And then we'd like to get your reaction to that.

[Emilio Alvarez]
Anything I'm missing?

[Gabriel Almeida]
No, I'm happy to take it, man. So I think Maya would be great to start off just to hear a little bit about how you work. So are you like a solo interior designer? Do you work for a firm? Do you have your own firm?

[Emilio Alvarez]
So what are you guys using?

[Gabriel Almeida]
Okay. let me ask you, Maya. So who does like the drafting or the renderings for you guys today? Do you do them yourselves?

[Gabriel Almeida]
so you don't. Have you ever thought about hiring someone, maybe overseas for

[Gabriel Almeida]
And what's the usual budget that you work with and what type of projects do you do? Do you do like new builds or only renovations?

[Emilio Alvarez]
Right. I can.

[Gabriel Almeida]
And do you see yourself scaling in the future? And if so, how do you see that growth happening?

[Gabriel Almeida]
Out, virtual assistant, that's just an AI agent or it's actually a remote in person.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Yeah, that's what I was going to ask. Right. what are you going to do about the renderings and the drawings when it's just like you're biting on more than you can chew.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Right. but do you see yourself kind of scaling with building relationships with drafters and renders overseas and scaling through that way, or do you see more potentially as soon as possible, like hiring someone full time in the US with you to do this type of groundwork for the project?

[Gabriel Almeida]
well, we see a lot is what we're seeing in the industry a lot. I think we now have 30 calls with professionals like yourself, Maya. Especially the higher end firms that have been in business for longer and doing like, you know, bigger budgets every year. They. They do a mix of both. Right? a mix of overseas talent to do more manual rendering, for us, my. Is to just be like, brutally honest.

[Gabriel Almeida]
I think the worst thing you can do is say that something is cool and valuable just so like designers.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Okay, good. All right. So it doesn't really. Well, maybe it applies to the work that you do with Your partner, right on the other side of the US I just don't know how you guys split your tasks, but what we're envisioning you doing, Maya, is basically creating a digital environment, right? a website that you can do all your drafting and rendering iteration process on. So all the revision work that you do in an instructured manner, just pass over PDF files and you annotate and right cross There's, from what we understand, it's a very iterative process, from drawing 0 until drawing 10.

[Gabriel Almeida]
And then there's drawings that you need to make for the millworker, for the gc, there's drawings for the client, right? And it's a similar kind of workflow for the rendering, right? It's still like you got to give the renderer the drawings with the links and the fabric and the material and there's a back and forth and doesn't get it right the first time. So the whole idea is to get those two processes, specifically the interracial process for drafting and rendering off your unstructured channels and put it in an organized digital environment where you can do it with greater level of productivity and also things are not falling through the cracks, details, mistakes, right? So it's basically a tool for that.

[Gabriel Almeida]
We have some screens that we'd like to show you just to make it But let me pause there. Like, is the value for you clear and what we're pitching you know, is it not clear? Like, do you have any thoughts?

[Emilio Alvarez]
That's part of the idea.

[Emilio Alvarez]
Before I show you, can you tell me a bit more about what frustrated you about that process?

[Emilio Alvarez]
How did you guys manage who owns which action item there?

[Gabriel Almeida]
And how do you do it with your partner? Now, Maya, like, do you guys iterate on drawings and renderings together or you take some and she takes the others? Like, how do you do it Today.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Okay, okay. But who does. But who makes the four plans?

[Gabriel Almeida]
Who makes the floor plans? the drafting?

[Emilio Alvarez]
So.

[Gabriel Almeida]
but, like, is there, like, is there in it. Is like, an iterative process now with your drafting and rendering? Or is it just, like, all on your plate and there's no one really giving you feedback on it? Like, on what to change and what to, you know?

[Gabriel Almeida]
So she tells like, she's, like, a bunch of revisions, like, all the time. Just like you were in the architecture firm.

[Emilio Alvarez]
There's.

[Gabriel Almeida]
There's. There's days that I wish that I could just go around barking at a meter, but I can't do that.

[Emilio Alvarez]
but, it would be a Chihuahua Yeah, I'm kidding. No. Okay, and so that's super helpful. And then the second thing before I show you, last thing I promise is, like, if you could envision an app that helps you do this, like, what are the key, like, features and, like, way of communicating, like, what would be your ideal vision?

[Gabriel Almeida]
I want to show you if you could wave, like, a magic wand like, I don't know, out of your, like, creativity now, like, have a tool that helps you do all this, like, iterative process of, like, drafting and rendering. Like, how would that look? Like, what would you be able to do? What would work? Well, let's see.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Sorry to interrupt you there, but you would want to create the modeling inside the platform. Like, you wouldn't want to, upload a file of the model and then go from there.

[Emilio Alvarez]
Got it.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Well, when I say drafting, more like floor plan, basic 2D stuff. Right. Like technical drawings. I'm talking about, like, drawing. Right. And then when I say rendering, it's like any modeling that you do. Right.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Okay, 3D.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Do you work a lot on your iPad? Like, do you draw a lot with it to make revisions and stuff?

[Gabriel Almeida]
Not gonna lie, I feel dumb but I've never heard of that in my life. What you just mentioned.

[Emilio Alvarez]
Oh, Wacom, one of the original ones. It's like the og.

[Gabriel Almeida]
So you use that with a pencil, right, to annotate drawings and stuff?

[Gabriel Almeida]
Okay, I think I know what it but now I think I know what it is.

[Emilio Alvarez]
It's like, imagine you have a super sensitive trackpad almost.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Yeah, that makes But sorry, Keep going. I interrupted you.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Right. What about, the capability of putting the ball in your court, your partner's court, as to like, who. Who has the next to do in the process? Right. either she needs to check your. Your drawings, your rendering, or you need to check her. Like, what about something like, indicate.

[Emilio Alvarez]
Okay, got it. And one of the. And I'll show you in a second. Like, one of the things we're considering is when you're leaving comments to. Have you ever used loom. Like, imagine if It allows you to record your screen, then also, like, share the common paste the comment. We're thinking about allowing you to like, live take Take a. Record your screen, show where you're going on the platform and leave that specific comment, transcribe and take out the action items from there. Is that something you would think is available? It's just a marginal improvement, like.

[Emilio Alvarez]
And with a transcription of those things.

[Emilio Alvarez]
and then the last thing, and then I'll show you what we're thinking is if you were to have. the. If you're leaving a comment, how important is it for you to just be able to like, drop a pin essentially on a part of the floor plan, versus you being able to make edits on an iPad. or wake them.

[Emilio Alvarez]
Yeah, exactly.

[Emilio Alvarez]
or the thing like, there's a difference between leech, in my mind, being able to, draw freehand and leave a comment. That's freehand versus, like, dropping a pin. And maybe that's something that we can show more visually.

[Emilio Alvarez]
Got it.

[Emilio Alvarez]
Got it. So what they say? Always show potential customers way before you want to show them. So it is still super early. But Hold on. Let me know when you can see my screen. And can you start seeing my screen?

[Emilio Alvarez]
Okay, So here's the idea. You have a set of projects. You have complex. You have different floor plans, etc. And you might have different versions, etc. You have your team that you're working with. It can be internal or external, all these kinds of things. We manage permissions. But you can open up the draft much like. Sorry, Zoom in a little.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Yeah, the whole window.

[Emilio Alvarez]
Yeah, hold Oh, you mean from like.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Yeah, let's see.

[Emilio Alvarez]
The zoom is not working great here.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Whatever, whatever.

[Emilio Alvarez]
Come on.

[Gabriel Almeida]
It's just hard to see, like, the buttons.

[Emilio Alvarez]
Yeah. This is what happens when you demo. Why is it not moving? It's not moving. Anyway, let's see. Let's go back.

[Emilio Alvarez]
Yeah. Okay, let's see. Zoom here. Is this better?

[Emilio Alvarez]
And so, like, the idea here like, imagine that this, you host all the revisions, but here you actually have that history that were talking about. Right. You can go on and here you can make drawings like, this can.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Be in your iPad. Right? It can be like, wherever.

[Emilio Alvarez]
In theory, you can like, what we're thinking as a first pass. Like, you click your mobile and gives you a QR code. Look at it on your iPad, and then you open and then you can draw on it there.

[Emilio Alvarez]
And then eventually we would have an integration, but then you also like, comments and a chat. So for example, that you're. That the person you're working with is Sarah. You can go and, like, get a voice on screen. You can reply to that specific comment.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Show her, like, how it would Create a comment, for example. I mean, press on the bubble there on the top next to the black.

[Emilio Alvarez]
Yeah, that's. Hold on, hold on.

[Gabriel Almeida]
To the right.

[Emilio Alvarez]
So here you would say something like this. Boom, Hi, this.

[Gabriel Almeida]
And then you can post it, right? you put an action. Right now they're just structured as common smile. But what we're thinking is the structure of them is actually action points so that she can click scene or reply to it and go back to the. comment amino.

[Emilio Alvarez]
And you can.

[Gabriel Almeida]
create. Create a new one.

[Emilio Alvarez]
Hold on.

[Gabriel Almeida]
So in the comment there, Maya, you can also click on media Emilio and you can choose to add a comment that's like a voice recording explaining something or a screen recording or both the screen and audio recording. Right. Then maybe you want to record something in your iPad with you, doing the drawings live so that she has And that's on the panel here, To watch, to really leave no room for ambiguity. You can upload pictures, right? And just literally add a picture there in the corner of the screen. What we're going to change now that's not working is like, the picture only. but that's basically the idea, right?

[Emilio Alvarez]
And the other thing that I want to show you the idea here is when you click on a previous version, you can click on this compare tool and what's going to happen is you're going to get. yeah, you're going to get a slider.

[Emilio Alvarez]
You'll get a slider pane right here that you can move to the left or right and it basically shows the same image side to And so as you can move it'll highlight the differences.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Yeah, it's basically imagine a window that you can slide open or shut to compare changes in each version. You know what I mean?

[Emilio Alvarez]
And you can also write the software so such that red adds a red line or something along those lines. So you can say like, hey, from A to B, here is where it changed. Like, I'm colorblind. So that wouldn't be super helpful for but I know for a lot of people it would be.

[Gabriel Almeida]
If you go back to the project view I made it real quick, just so I can mention something in Maya. And then the idea. Maya. like, for each, like, we're going to give you the ability to create folders and subfolders here to organize it a drive, right? as many layers as you And then you would be able once you have two on the screen. Right?

[Gabriel Almeida]
the idea is like when you back up to this screen, when you're just seeing all your drawings for a project and you're iterating and all, a lot of them with their partner, you're going to be able to see at what stage they are. You see that this one on the left in So we're going to add way more detail to that so that whoever is looking at the drawing without clicking in it is aware of the step that it's in. Right. So did Maya just review and now her partner needs to go in and or did Maya just literally upload this and no one put any comment yet? Like, it will be very descriptive of the stage that it is.

[Gabriel Almeida]
So you know what's going on in that drawing and what's needed as a next step before you even open it. Right.

[Emilio Alvarez]
And the idea is that you can manage all your projects in this way.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Yeah, Then you can obviously filter with a view to see what, like, based on you know, what's in my inbox, stuff to DOS like, anything. So. But I think that's basically like.

[Emilio Alvarez]
The idea for the initial vision, which would be super good for us, Maya, is like, can you tell us a bit more about what do you think works? Well, what doesn't? Are we missing anything that you think we. We have to have before you would buy this kind of

[Gabriel Almeida]
Or do you think it's whatever, And you don't really see yourself ever paying for something like I don't know.

[Gabriel Almeida]
How does that work?

[Emilio Alvarez]
Something would fit.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Nice so that, like, you can actually understand. Like, what is it? a ruler that kind of pops up and gives you actual dimensions of like, how things would look or like, how does that.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Yeah, how do I tell that to my developer, Maya?

[Gabriel Almeida]
how would that look like, how do we structure this to accomplish what you just asked for?

[Gabriel Almeida]
Got So maybe something short summary of.

[Emilio Alvarez]
the comments or outstanding items or something.

[Gabriel Almeida]
So way to understand how much work each thing is going to take before, like, without Having to dive into it and click on it. So maybe like, if you hover your mouse over it, a bunch of info about it pops up or like, I don't know, we can come up with something but I got it.

[Emilio Alvarez]
Gotcha.

[Gabriel Almeida]
So a way to resolve the comment or classify it as complete, basically the top.

[Emilio Alvarez]
Even like, even a quick thing where it's acknowledged or read or something.

[Emilio Alvarez]
Okay, that's good to know.

[Emilio Alvarez]
In theory.

[Gabriel Almeida]
If we have one ver, the first version is the raw drawing, and then the second version is a drawing with a bunch of And then the third version, for example, can be like the new drawing, right. That's And once that new drawing is uploaded, like, have an intelligence in the platform that actually checks out the new drawing that was uploaded compared to the comments and changes.

[Gabriel Almeida]
no, it makes sense.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Anything

[Emilio Alvarez]
Can you say more?

[Gabriel Almeida]
Gotcha, gotcha. I think that's more like, about how you use it than changing the functionality.

[Emilio Alvarez]
Yeah, probably.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Yeah, Got you. Is there anything that, like, you don't like, Like, the way you're seeing things? I don't know.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Okay. Do you like like, black and white or do you want, more color? Do you not care at all?

[Emilio Alvarez]
And then one of the things that we are all also and I'm curious if there's something that you've Is that often the communication?

[Gabriel Almeida]
Oh, wait, Sorry. Before you go into that, like, there's more things I want to like, make sure, like, we cover with myos before we mix things. So Maya, like, based on what we told you in division here, like, how valuable do you think that this tool, assuming that we make it work exactly the way you just requested it to be? Right. Like, how valuable would it be for you today to work with your partner that's like, in the other coast?

[Gabriel Almeida]
And what's like, we're not looking to make any commitments here, am I? We're not going to hold you to, like, anything you say. Right. But we're trying to understand, like, the value the market, like, gives to this. Right. People that actually would be our customers in the future. like, what would be, like, the max that you'd be like, paying for it? Obviously, we're not gonna put the price but just to understand, like, that's the ceiling of. Right. So, like, what's the max that you would be like, maybe I would pay this and for sure I would pay this.

[Gabriel Almeida]
How much do you pay for Adobe per

[Gabriel Almeida]
Okay, so what's how. like, so many designers told us that they use like, the bigger firms. Like, so what is it like, good for. Why do you think there's so many, like, interior design firms and architecture firms.

[Emilio Alvarez]
Gotcha.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Okay, cool.

[Emilio Alvarez]
And quick question. And, like, the. The price that you mentioned is that. That I'm just. I just want to make sure we're talking the same thing that would be, like, for this specific functionality that we're showing you now. Right. If were to add functionality, you would see value in additional and other things. Like, for example, helping you manage the projects like you were talking earlier.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Okay. And how, like, how good does Asana work for you? Like, you happy with it, with what you pay for it, the way it or it, like, it's not the best fit for your type of

[Gabriel Almeida]
So how hard would it be for us to, like, build project management in this tool? Apart from what we showed you, Maya, to get you to want to switch out of Asana to, like, be something better than it? And if you won't, if you don't think it would be that hard to make something that's, like, better than Asana, for you? Like, would you be willing to pay more than 20amonth if were offering all that?

[Gabriel Almeida]
Yep.

[Gabriel Almeida]
But it would have to be an upgrade from the free version of Asana, basically.

[Emilio Alvarez]
And what would an upgrade mean in your case?

[Gabriel Almeida]
Like, Like, is it clear to like, the things that you would done better in Asana because maybe the free version is capping you to do or just the way the Asana software works isn't. Isn't a good fit.

[Gabriel Almeida]
You're making me question now the whole folder management thing that we talked about here specifically for the drafting and for the renderings. Is there a better way for us to do it for you instead of Since you just said that folders aren't good.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Okay, got it.

[Emilio Alvarez]
You know what you're talking about?

[Emilio Alvarez]
And then, like, one of the other things that we keep hearing, and I'm curious if this happens to you just because you guys are a smaller firm, so that might not happen as much. But one of the things that we are hearing pretty often is that the communication process, both within the firm, but also with other partners, an architect, a gc, all those guys can be quite hectic because part of the communication comes from WhatsApp. Some of it is an email. Some of it might be, like, someone uses, like, texts and. Or someone uses. I don't. Telegram or what have you. And that often having different.

[Emilio Alvarez]
Having the same people communicate with you or different channels causes a disconnect like, what is the right file, what are the action items, what is due when, who's doing what, all those things. Is that something that you experience all the time?

[Emilio Alvarez]
Got. Right.

[Gabriel Almeida]
But I think. what I'm just trying to get to, Maya is like, there's this whole separate idea that doesn't have anything to do like, the drafting and the rendering, which is, like, you guys communicate in, like, dispersed communication channels, right? WhatsApp iMessage mail, like, call. Right. and the data scattered across all these channels usually for, like, interior scattered, right?

[Gabriel Almeida]
So the idea would be, like, for us to create, basically, like, a middleware type of communication software where it's an application on your phone or a website that you open that connects to all your communication channels. So we have an API to your email, we have an API to your. WhatsApp to your iMessage. And you can like, search up like a client. Imagine Milo's a client and you can search up Emilio and see like, all the scrape and all the data being pulled from all these separate channels. So you can see like, everything that's related with Amido and like, AI go through it and be like, by the way, it looks like, Maya, you need to do this and that, and here are those files.

[Gabriel Almeida]
So it's a way for you try to visualize everything that's scattered across the channels and like, in a centralized version, in a centralized way to consume what's being communicated to but also, to broadcast from, right. So that you don't have to go to iMessage, get a screenshot, put in an attachment in the mail, and let's send it. a way to also, like, broadcast, like, faster, right? Like, oh, I see how this came into my WhatsApp. a draft, right? That I can just hit send. So it's completely different from this, but it's an idea we had. So how, like, what do you think of that? Like, would that be something that's, valuable to you or not really.

[Emilio Alvarez]
Interesting. Why is that?

[Gabriel Almeida]
Yeah. The GCS wouldn't have to use anything, Maya. This would just be for you and your team.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Exactly. So if you send a message, more or less, you would like. You would basically have a screen that you see. Like, this is why my WhatsApp, this is my email. And whatever else you want to. To like, connect to. Right, exactly. your channels.

[Emilio Alvarez]
This is also super early, Maya. Like, Imagine that you have a channel that's like, for this complex. Here's the client communication. Here's what he's saying. Let me create a task, blah. All that stuff gets assigned. But also internally, if the client said something, we can have an internal chat to make sure that we're actually not dropping it. We create tasks, it helps you manage But what's happening under the hood is that if Michael Rivers sent you an email, it will reply via email.

[Gabriel Almeida]
So it's basically a way for you to control your channels in a centralized way. So you don't have to open your email, you don't have to open your WhatsApp, you don't have to open your imessage. this is all connected to those. Right. And you receive whatever comes through any of those channels here in one place. And you can send anything to any of those channels, forward from one channel to another from here as well. Right.

[Emilio Alvarez]
And you can determine when you send it to all channels versus just one tap versus Slack and all those kinds of things.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Got it. Cool.

[Gabriel Almeida]
That's all we would do.

[Emilio Alvarez]
That's good to know. And the last question that I have is like, do you feel like if were to do both things, both this and the collaboration software, like, do you think those make sense as two sub products of one company? Or do you think like, no, they're two completely different things. In other words, like, if I were to. If were to develop this as part of this process, do you think that makes sense for you as a user?

[Gabriel Almeida]
Or even like, it could even backfire me to. In the sense of if we tell Maya that it's 30 bucks for the whole thing and she's but there's this whole thing that I don't really use and I'm not gonna use, she can be like, well, there's you know, I'm paying probably a part for something I'm not going to utilize. You know, I can create hesitancy.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Yeah, it's been super helpful. Sorry. We went a bit over here with the time, learned a lot. It'd be amazing if you're willing for us to you know, just bounce a future iteration of this, like, off you just to get your thoughts on it. If you're open to that.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Awesome. Thank you so much. like, thing. In our end, we always wrap up a call, like, asking this because now we're in complete research mode. Right. Trying to learn from as many people like you as we can. Do you have any other, like, colleagues, like, in the industry that maybe we can have a conversation to do? You would be willing to introduce us.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Yeah, Basically to have a call like we had with you,

[Gabriel Almeida]
Yeah, I think it would be more for interior design and architecture now. But you know, because there's some. Sometimes like, what we're seeing is there's a lot of like, high end mill workers for some reason that do a lot of shop drawing, so maybe they could be interested in this too, even some GCs. Who knows? So anyone you think that potentially could be like, I don't know, a good fit or have something to say that is of worth in this process and we would be really happy to have those conversations.

[Emilio Alvarez]
Awesome. Thanks so much, Maya.

[Gabriel Almeida]
All right, enjoy.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Bye. CLEAN FOR SFT LLM------

[Emilio Alvarez]
Just to give you some context. Maya, thanks for joining again. Gabe and I, we just graduated from MIT. We are part of an accelerator that's called Delta V. And the idea here is to basically take a lot of the things that you learn, especially around innovation, launching new companies, etcetera into And right now we're in the phase as we have some ideas on things that could be of value to folks like yourself, interior designers. But we really want to pressure test and make sure that we're actually addressing something that would make a difference in your daily life.

[Emilio Alvarez]
We're seeing some themes. By the way we want to do this is we want to first ask you some questions to better understand what pain, what things you might be, what is going well, what challenges you might and then from there we'd like, towards the end, show you us a super early version of what we're thinking might be And then we'd like to get your reaction to that.

[Emilio Alvarez]
Anything I'm missing?

[Gabriel Almeida]
No, I'm happy to take it, man. So I think Maya would be great to start off just to hear a little bit about how you work. So are you like a solo interior designer? Do you work for a firm? Do you have your own firm?

[Emilio Alvarez]
So what are you guys using?

[Gabriel Almeida]
Okay. let me ask you, Maya. So who does like the drafting or the renderings for you guys today? Do you do them yourselves?

[Gabriel Almeida]
so you don't. Have you ever thought about hiring someone, maybe overseas for

[Gabriel Almeida]
And what's the usual budget that you work with and what type of projects do you do? Do you do like new builds or only renovations?

[Gabriel Almeida]
Do you see yourself scaling in the future? And if so, how do you see that growth

[Gabriel Almeida]
Out, virtual assistant, that's just an AI agent or it's actually a remote in person.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Yeah, that's what I was going to ask. Right. what are you going to do about the renderings and the drawings when it's just like you're biting on more than you can chew.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Right. but do you see yourself kind of scaling with building relationships with drafters and renders overseas and scaling through that way, or do you see more potentially as soon as possible, like hiring someone full time in the US with you to do this type of groundwork for the project?

[Gabriel Almeida]
well, we see a lot is what we're seeing in the industry a lot. I think we now have 30 calls with professionals like yourself, Maya. Especially the higher end firms that have been in business for longer and doing like, you know, bigger budgets every year. They. They do a mix of both. Right? a mix of overseas talent to do more manual rendering, for us, my. Is to just be like, brutally honest.

[Gabriel Almeida]
I think the worst thing you can do is say that something is cool and valuable just so like designers.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Okay, good. All right. So it doesn't really. Well, maybe it applies to the work that you do with Your partner, right on the other side of the US I just don't know how you guys split your tasks, but what we're envisioning you doing, Maya, is basically creating a digital environment, right? a website that you can do all your drafting and rendering iteration process on. So all the revision work that you do in an unstructured manner, just pass over PDF files and you annotate and right cross There's, from what we understand, it's a very iterative process, from drawing 0 until drawing 10.

[Gabriel Almeida]
And then there's drawings that you need to make for the millworker, for the gc, there's drawings for the client, right? And it's a similar kind of workflow for the rendering, right? It's still like you got to give the renderer the drawings with the links and the fabric and the material and there's a back and forth and doesn't get it right the first time. So the whole idea is to get those two processes, specifically the interracial process for drafting and rendering off your unstructured channels and put it in an organized digital environment where you can do it with greater level of productivity and also things are not falling through the cracks, details, mistakes, right? So it's basically a tool for that.

[Gabriel Almeida]
We have some screens that we'd like to show you just to make it But let me pause there. Like, is the value for you clear and what we're pitching you know, is it not clear? Like, do you have any thoughts?

[Emilio Alvarez]
That's part of the idea.

[Emilio Alvarez]
Before I show you, can you tell me a bit more about what frustrated you about that process?

[Emilio Alvarez]
How did you guys manage who owns which action item there?

[Gabriel Almeida]
And how do you do it with your partner? Now, Maya, like, do you guys iterate on drawings and renderings together or you take some and she takes the others? Like, how do you do it Today.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Okay, But who does. But who makes the floor plans?

[Gabriel Almeida]
Who makes the floor plans? the drafting?

[Emilio Alvarez]
So.

[Gabriel Almeida]
but, like, is there, like, is there in it. Is like, an iterative process now with your drafting and rendering? Or is it just, like, all on your plate and there's no one really giving you feedback on it? Like, on what to change and what to, you know?

[Gabriel Almeida]
So she tells like, she's, like, a bunch of revisions, like, all the time. Just like you were in the architecture firm.

[Gabriel Almeida]
There's. There's days that I wish that I could just go around barking at a meter, but I can't do that.

[Emilio Alvarez]
but, it would be a Chihuahua Yeah, I'm kidding. No. Okay, and so that's super helpful. And then the second thing before I show you, last thing I promise is, like, if you could envision an app that helps you do this, what are the key, features and, like, way of communicating, like, what would be your ideal vision?

[Gabriel Almeida]
I want to show you if you could wave, like, a magic wand like, I don't know, out of your, like, creativity now, like, have a tool that helps you do all this, like, iterative process of, like, drafting and rendering. Like, how would that look? Like, what would you be able to do? What would work? Well, let's see.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Sorry to interrupt you there, but you would want to create the modeling inside the platform. Like, you wouldn't want to, upload a file of the model and then go from there.

[Emilio Alvarez]
Got it.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Well, when I say drafting, more like floor plan, basic 2D stuff. Right. Like technical drawings. I'm talking about, like, drawing. Right. And then when I say rendering, it's like any modeling that you do. Right.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Okay, 3D.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Do you work a lot on your iPad? Like, do you draw a lot with it to make revisions and stuff?

[Gabriel Almeida]
Not gonna lie, I feel dumb but I've never heard of that in my life. What you just mentioned.

[Emilio Alvarez]
Oh, Wacom, one of the original ones. It's like the og.

[Gabriel Almeida]
So you use that with a pencil, right, to annotate drawings and stuff?

[Gabriel Almeida]
Okay, I think I know what it but now I think I know what it is.

[Emilio Alvarez]
It's like, imagine you have a super sensitive trackpad almost.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Yeah, that makes But sorry, Keep going. I interrupted you.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Right. What about, the capability of putting the ball in your court, your partner's court, as to like, who. Who has the next to do in the process? Right. either she needs to check your. Your drawings, your rendering, or you need to check her. Like, what about something like, indicate.

[Emilio Alvarez]
Okay, got And I'll show you in a second. One of the things we're considering is when you're leaving comments to. Have you ever used loom? Like, imagine if you. It allows you to record your screen, then also, like, share the common paste the comment. We're thinking about allowing you to record your screen, show where you're going on the platform and leave that specific comment, transcribe and take out the action items from Is that something you would think is available?

[Emilio Alvarez]
And with a transcription of those things.

[Emilio Alvarez]
and then the last thing, and then I'll show you what we're thinking is if you were to have. If you're leaving a comment, how important is it for you to just be able to like, drop a pin essentially on a part of the floor plan, versus you being able to make edits on an iPad. or wake them.

[Emilio Alvarez]
Yeah, exactly.

[Emilio Alvarez]
Exactly. or the thing like, there's a difference between leech, in my mind, being able to, draw freehand and leave a comment. That's freehand versus, dropping a pin. And maybe that's something that we can show more visually.

[Emilio Alvarez]
Got it.

[Emilio Alvarez]
Got it. So what they say? Always show potential customers way before you want to show them. So it is still super early. But Hold on. Let me know when you can see my screen. And can you start seeing my screen?

[Emilio Alvarez]
Okay, So here's the idea. You have a set of projects.. You have different floor plans, etc. And you might have different versions, etc. You have your team that you're working with. It can be internal or external, all these kinds of things. We manage permissions. But you can open up the draft much like. Sorry, Zoom in a little.

[Emilio Alvarez]
Yeah. This is what happens when you demo. Why is it not moving? It's not moving. Anyway, let's see. Let's go back.

[Emilio Alvarez]
Yeah. Okay, let's see. Zoom here. Is this better?

[Emilio Alvarez]
And so, like, the idea here like, imagine that this, you list all the revisions, but here you actually have that history that were talking about. Right. You can go on and here you can make drawings like this.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Be in your iPad. Right? It can be like, wherever.

[Emilio Alvarez]
In theory, you can like, what we're thinking as a first pass. Like, you click your mobile and gives you a QR code. Look at it on your iPad, and then you open and then you can draw on it there.

[Emilio Alvarez]
And then eventually we would have an integration, but then you also like, comments and a chat. So for example, that you're. That the person you're working with is Sarah. You can go and, like, get a voice on screen. You can reply to that specific comment.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Show her, like, how it would create a comment, for example. I mean, press on the bubble there on the top next to the black.

[Emilio Alvarez]
Yeah, that's. Hold on, hold on.

[Gabriel Almeida]
To the right.

[Emilio Alvarez]
So here you would say something like this.

[Gabriel Almeida]
And then you can post it, right? you put an action. Right now they're just structured as common smile. But what we're thinking is the structure of them is actually action points so that she can click scene or reply to it and go back.

[Emilio Alvarez]
And you can.

[Gabriel Almeida]
create. Create a new one.

[Emilio Alvarez]
Hold on.

[Gabriel Almeida]
So in the comment there, Maya, you can also click on media Emilio and you can choose to add a comment that's like a voice recording explaining something or a screen recording or both the screen and audio recording. Right. Then maybe you want to record something in your iPad with you, doing the drawings live so that she has And that's on the panel here, To watch, to really leave no room for ambiguity. You can upload pictures, right? And just literally add a picture there in the corner of the screen. What we're going to change now that's not working is like, the picture only. but that's basically the idea, right?

[Emilio Alvarez]
And the other thing that I want to show you the idea here is when you click on a previous version, you can click on this compare tool and what's going to happen is you're going to get. yeah, you're going to get a slider.

[Emilio Alvarez]
You'll get a slider pane right here that you can move to the left or right and it basically shows the same image side to And so as you can move it'll highlight the differences.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Yeah, it's basically imagine a window that you can slide open or shut to compare changes in each version. You know what I mean?

[Emilio Alvarez]
And you can also write the software so such that red adds a red line or something along those lines. So you can say like, hey, from A to B, here is where it changed. Like, I'm colorblind. So that wouldn't be super helpful for but I know for a lot of people it would be.

[Gabriel Almeida]
If you go back to the project view I made it real quick, just so I can mention something in Maya. And then the idea. Maya. like, for each, like, we're going to give you the ability to create folders and subfolders here to organize it a drive, right? as many layers as you And then you would be able once you have two on the screen. Right?

[Gabriel Almeida]
the idea is like when you back up to this screen, when you're just seeing all your drawings for a project and you're iterating and all, a lot of them with their partner, you're going to be able to see at what stage they are. You see that this one on the left in So we're going to add way more detail to that so that whoever is looking at the drawing without clicking in it is aware of the step that it's in. Right. So did Maya just review and now her partner needs to go in and or did Maya just literally upload this and no one put any comment yet? Like, it will be very descriptive of the stage that it is.

[Gabriel Almeida]
So you know what's going on in that drawing and what's needed as a next step before you even open it. Right.

[Emilio Alvarez]
And the idea is that you can manage all your projects in this way.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Yeah, Then you can obviously filter with a view to see what, like, based on you know, what's in my inbox, stuff to DOS like, anything. So. But I think that's basically like.

[Emilio Alvarez]
The idea for the initial vision, which would be super good for us, Maya, is like, can you tell us a bit more about what do you think works? Well, what doesn't? Are we missing anything that you think we. We have to have before you would buy this kind of

[Gabriel Almeida]
Or do you think it's whatever, And you don't really see yourself ever paying for something like I don't know.

[Gabriel Almeida]
How does that work?

[Emilio Alvarez]
Something would fit.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Nice so that, like, you can actually understand. Like, what is it? a ruler that kind of pops up and gives you actual dimensions of like, how things would look or like, how does that.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Yeah, how do I tell that to my developer, Maya?

[Gabriel Almeida]
how would that look like, how do we structure this to accomplish what you just asked for?

[Gabriel Almeida]
Got So maybe something short summary of.

[Emilio Alvarez]
the comments or outstanding items or something.

[Gabriel Almeida]
So a way to understand how much work each thing is going to take before, like, without Having to dive into it and click on it. So maybe if you hover your mouse over it, a bunch of info about it pops up or like, I don't know, we can come up with something but I got it.

[Emilio Alvarez]
Gotcha.

[Gabriel Almeida]
So a way to resolve the comment or classify it as complete, basically the top.

[Emilio Alvarez]
Even like, even a quick thing where it's acknowledged or read or something.

[Emilio Alvarez]
Okay, that's good to know.

[Emilio Alvarez]
In theory.

[Gabriel Almeida]
the first version is the raw drawing, and then the second version is a drawing with a bunch of annotations. And then the third version, for example, can be like the new drawing, right. That's And once that new drawing is uploaded, like, have an intelligence in the platform that actually checks out the new drawing that was uploaded compared to the comments and changes.

[Gabriel Almeida]
no, it makes sense.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Anything

[Emilio Alvarez]
Can you say more?

[Gabriel Almeida]
Gotcha, gotcha. I think that's more like, about how you use it than changing the functionality.

[Emilio Alvarez]
Yeah, probably.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Yeah, Got you. Is there anything that, like, you don't like, Like, the way you're seeing things? I don't know.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Okay. Do you like like, black and white or do you want, more color? Do you not care at all?

[Emilio Alvarez]
And then one of the things that we are all also and I'm curious if there's something that you've Is that often the communication?

[Gabriel Almeida]
Oh, wait, Sorry. Before you go into that, like, there's more things I want to like, make sure, like, we cover with myos before we mix things. So Maya, like, based on what we told you in division here, like, how valuable do you think that this tool, assuming that we make it work exactly the way you just requested it to be? Right. Like, how valuable would it be for you today to work with your partner that's like, in the other coast?

[Gabriel Almeida]
Okay. And what's like, we're not looking to make any commitments here. We're not going to hold you to, like, anything you say. Right. But we're trying to understand, like, the value the market, like, gives to this. Right. People that actually would be our customers in the future. like, what would be, like, the max that you'd be like, paying for it? Obviously, we're not gonna put the price but just to understand, like, that's the ceiling of. Right. So, like, what's the max that you would pay, but, like, you would be like, maybe I would pay this and for sure I would pay this.

[Gabriel Almeida]
How much do you pay for Adobe per

[Gabriel Almeida]
Okay, so what's how. like, so many designers told us that they use especially the bigger firms. Maya. so good fo?. Why do you think there's so many, interior design firms and architecture firms.

[Emilio Alvarez]
Gotcha.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Okay, cool.

[Emilio Alvarez]
And quick question. And, like, the. The price that you mentioned is that. That I'm just. I just want to make sure we're talking the same thing that would be, like, for this specific functionality that we're showing you now. Right. If were to add functionality, you would see value in additional and other things. Like, for example, helping you manage the projects like you were talking earlier.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Okay. And how, like, how good does Asana work for you? Like, you happy with it, with what you pay for it, the way it or it, like, it's not the best fit for your type of

[Gabriel Almeida]
So how hard would it be for us to, like, build project management in this tool? Apart from what we showed you, Maya, to get you to want to switch out of Asana to, like, be something better than it? And if you won't, if you don't think it would be that hard to make something that's, like, better than Asana, for Would you be willing to pay more than 20 a month if were offering all that?

[Gabriel Almeida]
Yep.

[Gabriel Almeida]
But it would have to be an upgrade from the free version of Asana, basically.

[Emilio Alvarez]
And what would an upgrade mean in your case?

[Gabriel Almeida]
Like, Like, is it clear to like, the things that you would done better in Asana because maybe the free version is capping you to do or just the way the Asana software works isn't. Isn't a good fit.

[Gabriel Almeida]
You're making me question now the whole folder management thing that we talked about here specifically for the drafting and for the renderings. Is there a better way for us to do it for you instead of Since you just said that folders aren't good.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Okay, got it.

[Emilio Alvarez]
And then, one of the other things that we keep hearing, and I'm curious if this happens to you just because you guys are a smaller firm, so that might not happen as much. But one of the things that we are hearing pretty often is that the communication process, both within the firm, but also with other partners, an architect, a gc, all those guys can be quite hectic because part of the communication comes from WhatsApp. Some of it is an email. Some of it might be, like, someone uses, like, texts and. Or someone uses. I don't. Telegram or what have you. And that often having different.

[Emilio Alvarez]
Having the same people communicate with you or different channels causes a disconnect like, what is the right file, what are the action items, what is due when, who's doing what, all those things. Is that something that you experience all the time?

[Gabriel Almeida]
But I think. what I'm just trying to get to, Maya is like, there's this whole separate idea that doesn't have anything to do like, the drafting and the rendering, which is, like, you guys communicate in, like, dispersed communication channels, right? WhatsApp iMessage mail, like, call. Right. and the data scattered across all these channels usually for interior designers. Right. And maybe you have a group chat per client right?

[Gabriel Almeida]
So the idea would be, like, for us to create a middleware type of communication software where it's an application on your phone or a website that you open that connects to all your communication channels. So we have an API to your email, we have an API to your. WhatsApp to your iMessage. And you can like, search up a client. Imagine Milo's a client and you can search up Emilio and see like, all the scrape and all the data being pulled from all these separate channels.

[Gabriel Almeida]
So it's a way for you try to visualize everything that's scattered across the channels and like, in a centralized version, in a centralized way to consume what's being communicated to but also, to broadcast from, right. So that you don't have to go to iMessage, get a screenshot, put in an attachment in the mail, and let's send it. a way to also, like, broadcast, like, faster, right? Like, oh, I see how this came into my WhatsApp. a draft, right? That I can just hit send. So it's completely different from this, but it's an idea we had. So how, like, what do you think of that? Like, would that be something that's, valuable to you or not really.

[Emilio Alvarez]
Interesting. Why is that?

[Gabriel Almeida]
Yeah. The GCS wouldn't have to use anything, Maya. This would just be for you and your team.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Exactly. So if you send a message, more or less, you would like. You would basically have a screen that you see. Like, this is why my WhatsApp, this is my email. And whatever else you want to. To like, connect to. Right, exactly. your channels.

[Emilio Alvarez]
This is also super early, Maya. Like, Imagine that you have a channel that's like, for this complex. Here's the client communication. Here's what he's saying. Let me create a task, blah. All that stuff gets assigned. But also internally, if the client said something, we can have an internal chat to make sure that we're actually not dropping it. We create tasks, it helps you manage But what's happening under the hood is that if Michael Rivers sent you an email, it will reply via email.

[Gabriel Almeida]
So it's basically a way for you to control your channels in a centralized way. So you don't have to open your email, you don't have to open your WhatsApp, you don't have to open your imessage. this is all connected to those. Right. And you receive whatever comes through any of those channels here in one place. And you can send anything to any of those channels, forward from one channel to another from here as well. Right.

[Emilio Alvarez]
And you can determine when you send it to all channels versus just one tap versus Slack and all those kinds of things.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Got it. Cool.

[Gabriel Almeida]
That's all we would do.

[Emilio Alvarez]
That's good to know. And the last question that I have is like, do you feel like if were to do both things, both this and the collaboration software, like, do you think those make sense as two sub products of one company? Or do you think like, no, they're two completely different things. In other words, like, if I were to. If were to develop this as part of this process, do you think that makes sense for you as a user?

[Gabriel Almeida]
Or even like, it could even backfire me to. In the sense of if we tell Maya that it's 30 bucks for the whole thing and she's but there's this whole thing that I don't really use and I'm not gonna use, she can be like, well, there's you know, I'm paying probably a part for something I'm not going to utilize. You know, I can create hesitancy.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Yeah, it's been super helpful. Sorry. We went a bit over here with the time, learned a lot. It'd be amazing if you're willing for us to you know, just bounce a future iteration of this, like, off you just to get your thoughts on it. If you're open to that.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Awesome. Thank you so much. like, thing. In our end, we always wrap up a call, like, asking this because now we're in complete research mode. Right. Trying to learn from as many people like you as we can. Do you have any other, like, colleagues, like, in the industry that maybe we can have a conversation to do? You would be willing to introduce us.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Yeah, Basically to have a call like we had with you,

[Gabriel Almeida]
Yeah, I think it would be more for interior design and architecture now. But you know, because there's some. Sometimes like, what we're seeing is there's a lot of like, high end mill workers for some reason that do a lot of shop drawing, so maybe they could be interested in this too, even some GCs. Who knows? So anyone you think that potentially could be like, I don't know, a good fit or have something to say that is of worth in this process and we would be really happy to have those conversations.

[Emilio Alvarez]
Awesome. Thanks so much, Maya.

[Gabriel Almeida]
All right, enjoy.

[Gabriel Almeida]
Bye.
