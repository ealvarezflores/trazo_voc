Input
"[Samarth Gwalani] Yeah, so I've worked on various scales of projects ranging from doing interiors for homes, building actual homes in New Jersey, Maine, Long island, stuff like as well as doing commercial projects such as shopping centers and then all the way up to stadiums seen a broad range.  [Samarth Gwalani] It was Everton's new stadium that just opened Yeah, that's correct.  [Samarth Gwalani] I left."
I'm no longer an architect.
"So by the time we finished the drawings, it took a few years and stuff to get So it's on my bucket list to go there.  [Samarth Gwalani] So that was one of them."
And the process is significantly different for all of them.
"I can start maybe with the stadiums, how it looks more formally and then work my way down to smaller projects if that's That's great."
"So for stadiums, it starts with the company that's trying to build the stadium, putting to schematic designs.  [Samarth Gwalani] And then you like, you basically put that schematic in the shortlist."
"A few firms, or they select the form they want to go with for the schematic and you actually take feedback from them and build out the entire stadium schematic being like, no, we need capacity like this, we kind of want more historical elements, blah, So you refine the design and get it to a point that it's like a fully fleshed 3D model in the sense, as well as basic drawing sets where you see the floor plan, the room organizations."
"You don't go into like plumbing, electricals or anything at schematic stage."
"And once they're happy with the schematics, you basically are continuously qualifying for subsequent rounds."
"So they're three rounds, schematic drawings.  [Samarth Gwalani] Yeah, you can. for example, a firm that's really creative would do the schematics and maybe a firm sometimes they'd qualify for design development, but then construction documents."
They'd want to go to A Com or a massive company that has experience of putting together these projects because they're good at specifying the products and stuff.
"This specifically works for big projects, rarely for smaller projects in general.  [Samarth Gwalani] and the expertise level doesn't require that high bar. if you're putting to an."
"Putting together an airport, you need to be able to source massive structural members and And a small design firm is not equipped for that."
It just slows them down in So you tend to switch to large firm.
"And especially if you're doing it in Everton, then there'd be a local firm that will detail it for materials permissions and processes within that region."
But schematics is less rigid to the region in general.  [Samarth Gwalani] So you qualify for design development.
Design development typically looks at adding everything in to make it look like a fully fledged building.
"Electrical, plumbing and everything."
"Once that's confirmed, it's construction documents and that gets to the detail level."
How do materials meet?
How does specific conditions work?
And every part of the building is forensically put into place.
The 3D model gets overly complex over this period of time.
"Initially it's less complex, more massing, then slight design and then systems in place and then finally smaller pieces working together essentially."
So that's kind of how it is for construction drawings.
"And then taking you to the other end of things like homes, it works again.  [Samarth Gwalani] I would say a couple of million.  [Samarth Gwalani] no, the construction cost was 450 million or so.  [Samarth Gwalani] So the firm would make a couple of million doing the drawing set.  [Samarth Gwalani] And for homes, it's a different scale but you still have the same Three phases."
You draw up a plan concept.
The client likes it.
"Like you're working with a family typically or something, not like a formal body."
So it's very conversational.
"And then you continuously, like, develop it."
Some people will start building before the construction documents.
"They can, like, take the rough design development documents, start and then you, like, work with the contractor closely to tell him the construction details So trying to move the timeline up and like, development, like, construction drawing because that takes a lot of time.  [Samarth Gwalani] It's kind of closer to the stadium end of things."
"Like. a mall or something would be closer to a stadium.  [Samarth Gwalani] A full building or just the interiors between the two, where, like, you maybe work with the same form all the way through, but it's less complex than a stadium."
"But there still are a lot of requirements required in because you have a facade, you have, like, your structure, you have, like, a lot of things that go into it.  [Samarth Gwalani] Yeah."
"I mean, in schematic phase, you're moving between 2D and 3D."
"Like, typically these drawing sets could be but as you go into design, development and construction drawings, you want your 3D model to like, a source of truth and your 2D drawings to come out of it, so.  [Samarth Gwalani] It should be a view of your 3D model, but like, in it's less important because you're trying to portray an idea, you're trying to move faster, you're trying to."
It's about the vision.  [Samarth Gwalani] pretty much.
"I mean, you can be loose in it."
"Some views don't need to, like, like, mapped out.  [Samarth Gwalani] How they work?"
"I mean, if it's a smaller firm, you typically call the construction team up and you're like, it's very informal."
"But in larger projects, there's a proper handoff process where you get to a certain level and you have syncing calls between plumbing teams and the architect, engine and engineering teams and the architect, electrical teams and the architect."
"And the architect kind of coordinates these things  [Samarth Gwalani] And you definitely have maybe a 3D model accessible to them to add in layers of detail to.  [Samarth Gwalani] For smaller firms, the stakes are much lower."
So the informality makes it easy in some way.
"But for larger firms, it's super structured.  [Samarth Gwalani] I would say a smaller firm, I don't know, a smaller firm is like, they like the flexibility of just like making stuff."
"At least the ones that I've worked in that were smaller, they aren't that process driven."
"So there's, it's really informal."
"So I wouldn't say it's going badly or but it, I think it goes worse than larger firms, in my opinion."
But yeah.  [Samarth Gwalani] In terms of producing costs?  [Samarth Gwalani] In terms of outsourcing.
So if I'm an architecture firm and I'm trying to outsource some of the work to a third party.
"I like, typically we in the past have outsourced specifically for rendering and stuff like that because those become discrete deliverables."
"Not 365 days of the year you're not but you have renderers that renders that are required at the end of each phase, typically to show what the building looks So sometimes you can have a person that's skilled in the team that can do multiple things Or if you don't have that, then you typically outsource it to a rendering company because you don't need that service every day of the year, essentially.  [Samarth Gwalani] I mean, all companies do schematics But renders, a smaller company would make like."
"I'd say after a hundred person company would have maybe one or two renderers on their team, 500%."
"This thing, company or thousand company would have five or six renderers, through the year, doing representation and let an external agency just do something like which is helping you win the project with the renders.  [Samarth Gwalani] I think that's highly uncommon, honestly, none."
"Like, the drawings are always done with the company from all architecture firms that I'm familiar with as well as the ones that I've worked with."
"Like, you're pretty much."
That's like your source of you know.
You wouldn't outsource that. what?
Like I would say.
"Yeah, I wouldn't say many people outsource their drawings.  [Samarth Gwalani] So maybe in an interior design firm, if they're not technical enough to put together the details of how things come together, maybe they're doing it for that reason, so that they can focus on the vibes."
"But in an architecture firm, you typically always do it within the company.  [Samarth Gwalani] I think mainly you know, rendering marketing, that type of the."
The external company doesn't need to closely know exactly what.
How the building functions. the drawings.
They can take an artifact of 2D models or 3D models and just make it look good so that when the client gets it helps them get the bid and qualify for the next round.
"So you'd outsource it, making it look like super luxurious, super nice."
"And like painting the vision.  [Samarth Gwalani] Yeah, we did."
We outsourced moderately for those periods in time when were trying to do renders and videos and stuff like that.  [Samarth Gwalani] I think we did a US based company. it's easy to build and typically you get a budget from the client.
It's not going from your budget at this point because you've already qualified and are getting X amount of money for the proposal.
"So in that case you just work with the company you've always worked with and you just get them to do And they have a good portfolio, they have a good body of work."
"You trust the quality and stuff like that.  [Samarth Gwalani] Could be.  [Samarth Gwalani] why we wouldn't.  [Samarth Gwalani] Yeah, especially I worked in boutique designee firms, so they cared a lot about quality and craft, you know, while an Indian person can get the job done, marketing and rendering is a highly creative storytelling based thing."
"Like you've seen creative directors at all companies, they have a certain aesthetic about them."
"The way they talk, the way they think, it's like super abstract."
"And I guess they work to India, doing engineering work or something like but creative work, maybe the person is not as well was with an American creative director, for example.  [Samarth Gwalani] Yeah, I mean, the time zone is not a help here."
"Like, if it was about getting work done when I'm I'd expect it to be a super low communication type of work in But like, creative design is a high communication, high touch ideating type of like, work in general.  [Samarth Gwalani] Yeah."
"I mean, it would be helpful for me to know like, what you think the problem is with this thing."
Then it would be like.  [Samarth Gwalani] Got it.
"I mean, it could work."
"Like, which part of the process, based on the other conversations you've had, would you outsource to?  [Samarth Gwalani] Yeah, I always find, like, design outsourcing really hard because there's no source of truth in terms of if something is right or wrong."
"Whereas like, accounting or engineering, it's easier because, like, it either works or it doesn't work."
"It's binary, it's right or wrong in some sense."
"So in those cases, like, yeah, like, if I was Running my own creative practice, I'd be more skeptical about outsourcing than, like, building out people external help, but I'm not just, like, I'm not losing quality, essentially.  [Samarth Gwalani] Same time zone, same, like, cultural thought process."
"You'd want someone who's kind of, like, maybe gone to study in the US or something and, like, is running a firm back in Latin America."
"Something like, that would be ideal because then they can, like, speak things like, that.  [Samarth Gwalani] You don't think of bricks."
"So the materiality is different so that there's like, a slight issue in detailing it out because you don't know what material to reach for because you're not familiar with the climate and things like that.  [Samarth Gwalani] Yeah, I can message a few of my architecture friends and ask them to connect with you."
Some of them are actively doing architecture right now.
"I've not done architecture since 2019, so.  [Samarth Gwalani] So I'll reach out to them for sure.  [Samarth Gwalani] Yeah."
"Calm down, man.  [Samarth Gwalani] Yeah, I know."
Maria was really looking forward to so she's pretty bummed out.
We met Louis Bolio last weekend for.
That's for Raj's birthday.
Yeah.  [Samarth Gwalani] His house looked crazy when Ria showed me pictures of it.
"I'm sure it was Beautiful.  [Samarth Gwalani] Yeah, man."
"We gotta do it again when you're traveling back home.  [Samarth Gwalani] Yeah, that's But what about the.  [Samarth Gwalani] Yeah, fair enough."
And you're working with the co founder right now or.  [Samarth Gwalani] No.
Face it.  [Samarth Gwalani] Got.
"Got And are you specifically only looking at the alp, the building industry or other industries as well?  [Samarth Gwalani] Super interesting, man."
Let me know how it goes and I'll reach out to some of my friends.
"For sure.  [Samarth Gwalani] Of course, bro."
Let me know if you need anything else.
For sure.  [Samarth Gwalani] Bye.
"Bye.  [Samarth Gwalani] Yeah, I've worked on various scales of projects ranging from doing interiors for homes, building actual homes in New Jersey, Maine, Long island, stuff like as well as doing commercial projects such as shopping centers and then all the way up to stadiums seen a broad range  [Samarth Gwalani] It was Everton's new stadium that just opened Yeah, that's correct.

And the process is significantly different for all of them.
"I can start maybe with the stadiums, how it looks more formally and then work my way down to smaller projects if that's helpful For stadiums, it starts with the company that's trying to build the stadium, putting out tender offers or bids for proposals."
It's called an rfp.
"You put together your previous work in and then using that body of they ask you to maybe do a schematic for a certain part or a study and they give you as a firm, prioritize maybe two to two months to three months of schematic designs.  [Samarth Gwalani] And then you basically put that schematic in the shortlist."
"They select from the firms they want to go with for the schematic and you actually take feedback from them and build out the entire stadium schematic being like, no, we need capacity like this, we kind of want more historical elements, blah, So you refine the design and get it to a point that it's like a fully fleshed 3D model in the sense, as well as basic drawing sets where you see the floor plan, the room organizations."
