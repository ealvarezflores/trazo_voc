Input
"How are you doing?  [Maya Newlin] Okay, no worries.  [Maya Newlin] You can always move if that works  [Maya Newlin] good."
I'm going my bachelorette so that's why my schedule is a bit hectic.
"So thanks for making today work.  [Maya Newlin] Tulum.  [Maya Newlin] Oh, fun.  [Maya Newlin] What part?  [Maya Newlin] I."
"I've never but would love to go.  [Maya Newlin] Okay. a Cenote esque place.  [Maya Newlin] Oh, I've had that."
"And the big cup, it almost looks like a Michelada.  [Maya Newlin] Also your volume is very low for."
"For me.  [Maya Newlin] Give me a second.  [Maya Newlin] Maya, I."
I can hear yours now.
I think the background noise was.
"It was trying to cut out some of that so it made your voice really quiet.  [Maya Newlin] Yep.  [Maya Newlin] Okay, sounds great.  [Maya Newlin] Yeah, so I have my own firm with my business partner who's in LA right now."
I had to step away for a year.
I'm on the east Coast.  [Maya Newlin] Going back there.
"But yeah, essentially we've been managing it for the past year and a half, long distance, which has been really tricky time zones."
"You know, for design you kind of have to be in person for a lot of things."
"Just in general, it is a in person field."
"So we get on the phone every day, Google Meet, just to kind of work through But it has been challenging."
So I'm excited to see what you guys are working on because It needs.
"There needs to be something better than using five different programs a day to communicate.  [Maya Newlin] Well, we use the paid Google software."
"We do Asana for project management and then for visual management, we either share our Adobe files, InDesign, Photoshop."
"You know, we kind of have to tell each other whether we're in the model or not."
"Same with And then we use which is a 3D visualization kind of like a pin board type of And then both of us can be on there at the same time.  [Maya Newlin] Yeah, so we both do 3D models and renderings."
Yeah.  [Maya Newlin] Initially we had just because it's pretty cheap to get done on Fiverr and upwork.
But there's a little bit less control in terms of what the output looks like.
"And then with Our clients, we have some very particular clients that want quick turnarounds within you know, a few hours, let's say."
So we like to kind of have control of everything.
"Yes, we have thought about But right now our clients are kind of more like, can you just tweak this one thing?"
"And it's you know, the upwork person's not reliable."
Then we're kind of in a pickle and we look bad.  [Maya Newlin] We do new builds and renovations.
So primarily high end residential would be renovations for.
"We do a little bit of boutique, commercial and hospitality, which is kind of a complete gut."
"So partially new build, partially renovation, just to keep, you know, the code in. and then budget for residential is under a million."
"For commercial hospitality, up to 10 million. but those are large developments which.  [Maya Newlin] So we do have a virtual assistant that we use that's kind of like a part time thing that does like clerical work."
"So we're starting to scale on that in terms of just answering emails, reaching.  [Maya Newlin] We use a robot.  [Maya Newlin] That helps us with that."
And they also help us take meeting minutes as well for clients and formatting.
But we do have to manage that because we're kind of telling it what to do in a sense.
"Yeah, we are in the process of hiring a cpa, bookkeeper because we finally are getting in enough revenue where we need someone to come in monthly and kind of tally."
And then in terms of we resell as well.
So that's a big thing is collecting sales tax.
So that's the one that we're hiring to the team.
We're hiring a CFO as well.
"Again, we have only been around for a year and a half, so kind of still launching things.  [Maya Newlin] yeah, we plan to, hire maybe a designer part time when we get a contract for a bigger work and we know that there's going to you know, an influx and we're going to be able to pay them.  [Maya Newlin] Yeah, I think at that point we would outsource once we have that set budget."
Right now we're doing kind of short term projects with our clients because it's not.
They don't have investors all the way.
So it's not like a 100.
"They're kind of like, let's just see where this goes and then we might sign you guys on."
"So once we get signed on for the full package, that's probably when we would either hire or make the allocation you know, go with someone on upwork or fiverr.  [Maya Newlin] I think ideally in the US in person would be So someone in because then we can also designate them to go to site visits if we needed to."
"Usually people that do renders have I guess, assets that are worth, that are valuable to our team."
"If they were just purely rendering, then to your point, we probably would just hire someone overseas if that's the only thing they're checking off."
Otherwise we need help with.  [Maya Newlin] Know how to critique.
"So I got you guys.  [Maya Newlin] I mean, you kind of hit the nail on the head when you're it so many iterations, last minute tweaks, you know, we say redlining."
So I feel like that would be really interesting to have.
I'm curious how you're going to do it just because.
"So we both, my business partner and I, Jaz, we worked for an architect prior to starting our own company."
"And we both left because it was, we didn't like how it was being run."
"But typically they were like, this is how all architects, you know, kind of do their business in terms of iterations is having a hard copy or having basically you have a folder with every date on it that, where it's been iterated, where you can go back, Grab something and a client's like, I actually really liked this originally.  [Maya Newlin] So I'm wondering if there's a memory to what you're saying of going.  [Maya Newlin] Okay, great.  [Maya Newlin] Yeah, so usually it would be a design director marking it up for, let's say whoever, you know, typically the team, the person on that team would pick it up."
"In some cases, when they're out or they're sick or they're on site, someone else kind of has to step in."
"And yeah, things get lost in translation."
They didn't do something that they said they picked up.
"So then it kind of slips through, let's say multiple cracks."
"And then by the end of it's like, I've redlined this know, an honest mistake."
"But again, it hasn't been caught through the 5 iteration."
So it makes the firm look bad.
"But that happens all the time, to be honest.  [Maya Newlin] And then it's a last minute fix on site."
And it's always so stressful.
"And like, even if you have the best people, it happens."
"You know, there's so much to kind of keep track of.  [Maya Newlin] Working for the architect, it was always the design director assigning it to, let's say like drafter, designer, architect below them."
"So it'd be anyone the intermediate, let's say drafting."
So that could be.
"That could be me, that could be my teammate."
"It really Depends on how much work each person has for that project load. you know, you're assigned your projects."
"But if a team kind of has more than anticipated, then we step in to help."
"And that's kind of with every firm So.  [Maya Newlin] For our most recent project that we're doing a cookie shop, I do all the 3D modeling because it's more complex."
And then I'll send it over to her and she'll render it and then I'll do Photoshop on top of that.  [Maya Newlin] Say that again.  [Maya Newlin] I'd say it's a Mix of both.
Probably I'm the keeper of that project's and then she'd be the keeper of another model.  [Maya Newlin] So she.
She definitely gives me feedback.
"I think I'm the one that's more leading But she has, like, absolute input."
"Yeah.  [Maya Newlin] There's a little bit more respect, I because it's not this is wrong."
"It's more like, you know, maybe we should think about it this way."
"But most of the time, it's."
"She's like, you've been in this project longer."
"Like, you can kind of have, like, the leads if you think it's you know, amicable about it and not, like, power.  [Maya Newlin] You know, it gets cut throat.  [Maya Newlin] so I'd have all the integrations like, making a 3D model that like, let's say, complex curves and like, already built I think some of the platforms are lacking and you have to use, like.  [Maya Newlin] I mean, we."
"You could do that, too, I guess."
"When you say drafting, to me, that's starting from scratch on a Model.  [Maya Newlin] Unless you're just saying purely.  [Maya Newlin] Yeah."
"You could probably upload but in like, ideal world, I would doing all my modeling from drafting up in this one unit."
"And then it would have, like, a warehouse where things are easily downloadable."
"Whether it's like, there's an AI thing that converts, like, I want this exact piece of, let's say millwork or furniture from online to be the exact dimension."
So I'm not wasting my time modeling something that's kind of roughly the same size.
"So it kind of takes the dimensions, plops it into the model again, assigning exact textures for the render."
"So, like, if I go on a site and I'm shopping, I like this paint."
There's already like a.
An image that I can just assign to that.
"And then what else?  [Maya Newlin] Yeah, having like, the notes tab or a leader with saying, you know, it's marked on this date."
Or what do you think about this?
"So having like, almost like a little text bubble call out.  [Maya Newlin] For like."
I'm not quite sure about this yet.
"Let's put a pin on it.  [Maya Newlin] So I have a Wacom, not an iPad, but yes."
"Like, the little stylus is really nice."
"I want to get an iPad just because it's like, more like mobile.  [Maya Newlin] So I used to work with so we would always sketch on that."
It was a hand.
It's more of an Illustrator tool.
"And it has a screen, but it's also great for, like, handwriting, so I use that.  [Maya Newlin] but it plugs into my laptop, so it's like an extension screen, let's say.  [Maya Newlin] you know, it's a big screen, so.  [Maya Newlin] but that's And then it would have like, all the notes And then a history log of the."
This is when this was done.
So it would be able to save.
"Let's say we're working for like, 50% concepts."
"We always like to milestone mark like 25, 50, 75% and then archive it so that if we need to go back to the drawing board, those are already saved as they are before we do the changes to you know, design or something.  [Maya Newlin] You know, I think it'd be in like, the."
"Each person has a color, let's say."
"So, like, if I annotate, it'd be like red."
If she annotates it'd be like purple.
That's always what I imagined it.
"And it also have the username of the person, like, timestamped.  [Maya Newlin] Almost like a video."
"Like, this is what I'm live And then she can watch that at a later time.  [Maya Newlin] Oh, that would be cool."
I didn't even think of that.
"Yeah, I think that'd be nice.  [Maya Newlin] So you're saying with the pin, I would still be able to, like, add a note.  [Maya Newlin] It just wouldn't be a live edit in that time.  [Maya Newlin] I would say drawing visually is I guess, because sometimes it's hard to explain in your words what you want."
Especially something's changing And typically.
"Yeah, when we redline, we kind of test out, like, will it fit in this place?"
"So it'll be like, hey, let's try and move this here."
"So I think freehanding is actually really helpful still to have.  [Maya Newlin] Specifically like, space planning.  [Maya Newlin] It always gets weird when you share screen and try and, like, zoom for some reason.  [Maya Newlin] Yep.  [Maya Newlin] Oh, okay, nice.  [Maya Newlin] I'll visualize it.  [Maya Newlin] Yeah, I think that's really nice.  [Maya Newlin] Yeah, definitely the before and after.  [Maya Newlin] Well, the first actually initial thought when I saw this was like, this kind of looks like Bluebeam."
"And we used to use obviously, Windows, people don't use it anymore because I have a Mac. yeah, I mean, Bluebeam was great because you would kind of do the same thing."
"You would add a comment, you can insert photos and then also do you like real time dimensioning?"
"So I think a feature that would be great is to actually.  [Maya Newlin] So like, I guess the PDF is to scale or it knows it'll read you know, doorways, three foot."
So you can actually measure in the draft or the PDF.  [Maya Newlin] So that would be something that's really.  [Maya Newlin] Like.  [Maya Newlin] So there would be a.
"Yeah, a ruler up top."
"Let's say you click the ruler and let's say you would measure, you know, between the staircase and that chair."
"Just be like, hey, this looks a little, like, tight."
Can we measure that distance?
"Because sometimes when you're drafting, you're."
"You put things together quickly and you're the size of you know, table, whatever is really off."
"Like, let me just go in and measure it."
"And you know, it's like, that's way too big."
"And so doing that's nice.  [Maya Newlin] Going back to like, the folder section, I think what would also be helpful specifically for renders and floor plans is like, nitpicky, is like, it would show a preview of the actual PDF or image and review versus I think that's actually really helpful to have so it show exactly what you're uploading."
"Kind of like, just because I'm assuming that let's say we're going to have six iterations of the same project going on."
"I want to know where we are in each one.  [Maya Newlin] So I guess I mean, you're showing the same plan, but let's say there, you know, was an image or something."
It would actually show that image with maybe the comments that person had wrote.
"So if there's red bubbles everywhere that I need to check, I don't know, I kind of like seeing like, how much I need to go into and review before just clicking and being like, my God, there's 50 red lines I need to pick up.  [Maya Newlin] Because sometimes I'm like, oh, I'm gonna leave this till the last minute."
"Because I know there's only three things to pick up versus if there's like, more than that, I'm like, I need to save time for this.  [Maya Newlin] Yeah, just like, again, it's just quicker than clicking in and actually looking again."
You want things really quickly.
"Yeah, that would be helpful for I think.  [Maya Newlin] And then if you go back into the floor plan."
"Yeah, so I like the recording in the comment section where you can record the video saying, you know, hey, if we try moving you know, 45 degrees or something?"
I think that's a really helpful feature.
"Okay, I think it would be helpful."
"I guess, like, let's say there's a lot of comments to review."
"If I'm reviewing a comment, it almost grays out."
"Like I read that versus, you know, need to go back because it might get confusing."
"Like, I don't know if I looked at this or not."
So almost like highlighting it out.
That's done.  [Maya Newlin] Right.
"Or it's you know, actually let's talk about this in person or something like that."
"Like, just a little item that.  [Maya Newlin] Maybe color.  [Maya Newlin] And then this is really fancy, but let's say I want all the comments picked up within this image that you shared."
Then I re upload the same exact export to the new folder.
"It would be interesting to see if the technology could catch if I forgot one of the red lines.  [Maya Newlin] Yeah, I don't know if that makes sense."
"Let's say I forgot to, you know, move the table or And we said we move it 90°, rotate it and I uploaded it and the table is in the same exact position."
"It would be so cool if it was like, hey, you didn't catch this because it would overlay it and it would be like, this is the same."
"That's really advanced.  [Maya Newlin] Yeah, exactly."
"Like, that would be again, another kind of safehold step to being like, okay, human error."
"Like, I forgot to do And then it's like, let me go fix that really quickly before the next person reviews it."
"It just like, saves time because usually you were in a rush when we're doing these things like, sometimes you just don't."
You forget to do it.  [Maya Newlin] So that'd be great.  [Maya Newlin] I think assuming that one person is the reviewer.
"I think it'd be interesting to have you know, this would be great for a firm where we're delegating, a junior designer to kind of pick up the comments."
"It would be nice if there was a partner version where like, say, Jazz and Jasmine and I are kind of looking at it And it's not like I have more than she does."
"It's kind of more collaborative versus, hey, can you pick up these red lines?  [Maya Newlin] So I guess in this it's more action item of like, each person on the team is asking or saying, let's do And then the person reviewing is like, okay, Got that down."
"But if it's Jasmine and we want equal input, I guess what I'm commenting is not a full on action item that needs to be It's more of a comment to talk about.  [Maya Newlin] Or maybe."
"Yeah, it's like the color coding is just different or something.  [Maya Newlin] I mean, I think it's pretty standard when it comes to you know, your tools that are at the top and your comments, I feel like that looks fine to me.  [Maya Newlin] I think black and white is."
Is good for the base.
"Yeah, I don't like too much color.  [Maya Newlin] I'd say very valuable. like, Adobe is like, the worst."
"The Acrobat is like, the worst program to use it, like, sucks and it's always glitching."
"So I'd probably pay for it depending like, how much it costs.  [Maya Newlin] Okay."
"Maybe $20 a month, I or 19.99, let's say."
"But because we are like, we're kind of watching every subscription that we add on our plate."
"So, more realistically, right now, as of today, probably $10.  [Maya Newlin] Which is kind of like the Spotify subscription, you know, it like, feels right."
"Not too crazy because it's like we already have Adobe that we pay for and all of our other programs that like, add up.  [Maya Newlin] It's $69 because it's like you have to get all the sweets."
And then we pay for our license for.
"We do actually do CAD on an hourly license, but we have like, SketchUp, Endscape."
I'm trying to think of the other ones.
"We don't do Revit right now. like, had to stop that because it's just don't use it."
"It's so expensive.  [Maya Newlin] Google, our website fee."
It's it just never use Houzz.
"We have the free platform, but we're not like, work right now from there."
It's just referrals.  [Maya Newlin] That use it on Houzz?
"We don't have, like, a ton of experience with it."
"I feel like it's an easy, shopping platform."
"Like, you can integrate that.  [Maya Newlin] But maybe that's because they can, like, it keeps it all online versus, like, we don't have that many projects so we're kind of doing like, right from the ground if that makes sense."
"So it's probably just a volume thing.  [Maya Newlin] Like, almost like an Asana integration where it's."
More project task management.
"I feel like that would be like, up to, let's say, like, five users, so I wouldn't want to pay that per user.  [Maya Newlin] Like, I want the price to you know, up to a few users.  [Maya Newlin] We use a free version right now."
"I'd say it, like, gets the work done because, again, like, our team is not super huge."
It's not like we have to go in there every day.
"But back when were working with the Architect, we used it quite a bit you know, people were on different time zones and it actually worked like, delegating and, like, we paid for that version."
And so we actually kind of took the template from the previous.
The designer set it up.
"So we kind of took the template that she set up for it because it's, like, very organized and it's kind of once you work in a certain workflow, that's like, what you're used to.  [Maya Newlin] I don't know, would there be an app version so wouldn't just be desktop based?  [Maya Newlin] Okay, then I feel like, yeah, that's worth it."
"Maybe like 30, 40 then at the maximum.  [Maya Newlin] Exactly."
"Because there are a lot of free softwares out there where they let you do just enough to where it's like, okay, I can make this work and then everything else we'll just do, you know, over.  [Maya Newlin] I do like how Asana, you can do hours and tracking and there's a calendar view."
"So I mean, this would be interesting of like, okay, we want most of our renders done by this date and then you can kind of assign."
Let's say the file was on a timeline or something.
"Cause like, we're very visual people."
"Well, I'm a very visual person, so I like to kind of see things like designers are."
"Yeah. account. a live calendar, let's say."
"And so like, that's how I would like to look for things versus, going through the folder system."
"I feel like that would be interesting to see.  [Maya Newlin] Well, the way that you have it right now is yes, it's a folder, but there's an image to which is why I wanted the image to be actually live updated versus just it's saying PDF."
"So that does help me because it's I'm seeing that it's a folder, but I'm also recognizing like, oh, that iteration is from two months ago or, in a folder, there's still a visual side to it.  [Maya Newlin] But it will visualize it in a timeline of like, this is when things were edited, let's say."
"Like, I'm just imagining One of those, like, lighter, like, time things makes sense.  [Maya Newlin] Because contractors don't look at their email ever. like, only on the phone, usually by call, never by text."
"So, yes, I think this would be From what I'm seeing now, this is more of, like, an internal company use."
"Like, I don't think we would send this out to or share it with gcs, per se."
"Like, they kind of want, like, the final thing."
They don't really argue with what we send.
"They just, like, sure, build it."
"So I don't really see them, like, having input in, like, what we're doing.  [Maya Newlin] I think it sounds but I know, like, the GC wouldn't use it.  [Maya Newlin] Because that's just like, not how they."
"In my experience with the g, all the GC's I worked with, that's just not how they work."
"I mean, maybe it would, like, take some time to get you."
For them to get used to.
Because they're very old school.
"But usually it's yeah, just email is the only."
"Or, you know, a quick call. but they, I don't think would be."
"They don't have time to be using another app.  [Maya Newlin] Oh, for like, designers.  [Maya Newlin] Oh, that's interesting.  [Maya Newlin] no, that is nice."
I don't think we would use it.
"Like, I don't foresee myself using that right now.  [Maya Newlin] Like, don't use WhatsApp, don't use Slack."
Most of our stuff's through Google Chat.
"It'll be like, check your."
"But I don't think email, like, I think being in email is really nice because the way we organize it, we have our folder system Or tag on email.  [Maya Newlin] I do like but I just don't think personally we would use it.  [Maya Newlin] I'm gonna say no."
"I mean, I could see it being but I wouldn't want to pay for both of them at the same time."
Let's say that there was an umbrella price.
"I would see them as two separate services that I would pay for.  [Maya Newlin] Yeah, that's what I was thinking."
"I was like, I wouldn't pay for both of them."
"I'd pay for maybe this, but not for the other one."
"Just because I don't use, let's say the other integrations."
So maybe it could be an add on.
"I would definitely.  [Maya Newlin] For your app testing?  [Maya Newlin] Yeah, I could definitely send over some references if you want."
"Well, I have graphic designers. unless you just want specifically interior architecture.  [Maya Newlin] Okay, I'll go through my contact list and see who'd be a good fit.  [Maya Newlin] Thank you so much."
"All right, bye.  [Maya Newlin] Okay, sounds great.  [Maya Newlin] Yeah, so I have my own firm with my business partner who's in LA right now."
I had to step away for a year.
I'm on the east Coast.  [Maya Newlin] Going back there.
"But yeah, essentially we've been managing it for the past year and a half, long distance, which has been really tricky time zones."
"You know, for design you kind of have to be in person for a lot of things."
"Just in general, it is a in person field."
"So we get on the phone every day, Google Meet, just to kind of work through But it has been challenging."
So I'm excited to see what you guys are working on because It needs.
"There needs to be something better than using five different programs a day to communicate.  [Maya Newlin] Well, we use the paid Google software."
"We do Asana for project management and then for visual management, we either share our Adobe files, InDesign, Photoshop."
"You know, we kind of have to tell each other whether we're in the model or not."
"Same with And then we use which is a 3D visualization kind of like a pin board type of And then both of us can be on there at the same time.  [Maya Newlin] Yeah, so we both do 3D models and renderings."
Yeah.  [Maya Newlin] Initially we had just because it's pretty cheap to get done on Fiverr and upwork.
But there's a little bit less control in terms of what the output looks like.
"And then with Our clients, we have some very particular clients that want quick turnarounds within you know, a few hours, let's say."
So we like to kind of have control of everything.
"Yes, we have thought about But right now our clients are kind of more like, can you just tweak this one thing?"

So primarily high end residential would do renovations for.
"We do a little bit of boutique, commercial and hospitality, which is kind of a complete gut."
"So partially new build, partially renovation, just to keep, you know, the code in. and then budget for residential is under a million."
"For commercial hospitality, up to 10 million. but those are large developments which.  [Maya Newlin] So we do have a virtual assistant that we use that's kind of like a part time thing that does like clerical work."
"So we're starting to scale on that in terms of just answering emails, reaching.  [Maya Newlin] We use a robot.  [Maya Newlin] That helps us with that."
And they also help us take meeting minutes as well for clients and formatting.
But we do have to manage that because we're kind of telling it what to do in a sense.
"Yeah, we are in the process of hiring a cpa, bookkeeper because we finally are getting in enough revenue where we need someone to come in monthly and kind of tally."
And then in terms of we resell as well.
So that's a big thing is collecting sales tax.
So that's the one that we're hiring to the team.
We're hiring a CFO as well.
"Again, we have only been around for a year and a half, so kind of still launching things.  [Maya Newlin] yeah, we plan to, hire maybe a designer part time when we get a contract for a bigger work and we know that there's going to you know, an influx and we're going to be able to pay them.  [Maya Newlin] Yeah, I think at that point we would outsource once we have that set budget."
Right now we're doing kind of short term projects with our clients because it's not like. they have investors all the way.
So it's not a 100%.
"They're kind of like, let's just see where this goes and then we might sign you guys on."
"So once we get signed on for the full package, that's probably when we would either hire or make the allocation you know, go with someone on upwork or fiverr.  [Maya Newlin] I think ideally in the US in person would be So someone in because then we can also designate them to go to site visits if we needed to."
"Usually people that do renders have I guess, assets that are worth, that are valuable to our team."
"If they were just purely rendering, then to your point, we probably would just hire someone overseas if that's the only thing they're checking off."
Otherwise we need help with.  [Maya Newlin] Know how to critique.
"So I got you guys.  [Maya Newlin] I mean, you kind of hit the nail on the head when you're it so many iterations, last minute tweaks, you know, we say redlining."
So I feel like that would be really interesting to have.
I'm curious how you're going to do it just because.
"So we both, my business partner and I, Jaz, we worked for an architect prior to starting our own company."
"And we both left because it was, we didn't like how it was being run."
"But typically they were like, this is how all architects, you know, kind of do their business in terms of iterations is having a hard copy or having basically you have a folder with every date on it that, where it's been iterated, where you can go back, Grab something and a client's like, I actually really liked this originally.  [Maya Newlin] So I'm wondering if there's a memory to what you're saying of going.  [Maya Newlin] Okay, great.  [Maya Newlin] Yeah, so usually it would be a design director marking it up for, typically the person on that team would pick it up."
"In some cases, when they're out or they're sick or they're on site, someone else kind of has to step in."
"And so, yeah, things get lost in translation."
"They didn't do something that they said they picked So then it kind of slips through, let's say multiple cracks."
"And then by the end of it's like, I've redlined this five times."
"Like, why is it still here?"
And it's more of just an honest mistake.
"But again, it hasn't been caught through the 5 iteration."
So it makes the firm look bad.
"But that happens all the time, to be honest.  [Maya Newlin] And then it's a last minute fix on site."
And it's always so stressful.
"And like, even if you have the best people, it happens."
"You know, there's so much to kind of keep track of.  [Maya Newlin] Working for the architect, it was always the design director assigning it to, let's say like drafter, designer, architect below them."
"So it'd be anyone the intermediate, let's say drafting."
So that could be.
"That could be me, that could be my teammate."
"It really Depends on how much work each person has for that project load. you know, you're assigned your projects."
"But if a team kind of has more than anticipated, then we step in to help."
"And that's kind of with every firm So.  [Maya Newlin] For our most recent project that we're doing, a cookie shop, I do all the 3D modeling because it's more complex."
And then I'll send it over to her and she'll render it and then I'll do Photoshop on top of that.  [Maya Newlin] Say that again.  [Maya Newlin] I'd say it's a Mix of both.
Probably I'm the keeper of that project's and then she'd be the keeper of another model.  [Maya Newlin] So she.
She definitely gives me feedback.
"I think I'm the one that's more leading But she has, like, absolute input."
"Yeah.  [Maya Newlin] There's a little bit more respect, I because it's not this is wrong."
"It's more like, you know, maybe we should think about it this way."
"But most of the time, it's."
"She's like, you've been in this project longer."
"Like, you can kind of have, like, the leads if you think it's you know, amicable about it and not, like, power.  [Maya Newlin] You know, it gets cut throat.  [Maya Newlin] so I'd have all the integrations like, making a 3D model that like, let's say, complex curves and like, already built I think some of the platforms are lacking and you have to use, like.  [Maya Newlin] I mean, we."
"You could do that, too, I guess."
"When you say drafting, to me, that's starting from scratch on a Model.  [Maya Newlin] Unless you're just saying purely.  [Maya Newlin] Yeah."
"You could probably upload but in like, ideal world, I would doing all my modeling from drafting up in this one unit."
"And then it would have, like, a warehouse where things are easily downloadable."
"Whether it's like, there's an AI thing that converts, like, I want this exact piece of, let's say millwork or furniture from online to be the exact dimension."
So I'm not wasting my time modeling something that's kind of roughly the same size.
"So it kind of takes the dimensions, plops it into the model again, assigning exact textures for the render."
"So, like, if I go on a site and I'm shopping, I like this paint."
There's already like a.
An image that I can just assign to that.
"And then what else?  [Maya Newlin] Yeah, having like, the notes tab or a leader with saying, you know, it's marked on this date."
Or what do you think about this?
"So having like, almost like a little text bubble call out.  [Maya Newlin] For like."
I'm not quite sure about this yet.
"Let's put a pin on it.  [Maya Newlin] So I have a Wacom, not an iPad, but yes."
"Like, the little stylus is really nice."
"I want to get an iPad just because it's like, more like mobile.  [Maya Newlin] So I used to work with so we would always sketch on that."
It was a hand.
It's more of an Illustrator tool.
"And it has a screen, but it's also great for, like, handwriting, so I use that.  [Maya Newlin] but it plugs into my laptop, so it's like an extension screen, let's say.  [Maya Newlin] you know, it's a big screen, so.  [Maya Newlin] but that's And then it would have like, all the notes And then a history log of the."
This is when this was done.
So it would be able to save.
"Let's say we're working for like, 50% concepts."
"We always like to milestone mark like 25, 50, 75% and then archive it so that if we need to go back to the drawing board, those are already saved as they are before we do the changes to you know, design or something.  [Maya Newlin] You know, I think it'd be in like, the."
"Each person has a color, let's say."
"So, like, if I annotate, it'd be like red."
If she annotates it'd be like purple.
That's always what I imagined it.
"And it also have the username of the person, like, timestamped.  [Maya Newlin] Almost like a video."
"Like, this is what I'm live And then she can watch that at a later time.  [Maya Newlin] Oh, that would be cool."
I didn't even think of that.
"Yeah, I think that'd be nice.  [Maya Newlin] So you're saying with the pin, I would still be able to, like, add a note.  [Maya Newlin] It just wouldn't be a live edit in that time.  [Maya Newlin] I would say drawing visually is I guess, because sometimes it's hard to explain in your words what you want."
Especially something's changing And typically.
"Yeah, when we redline, we kind of test out, like, will it fit in this place?"
"So it'll be like, hey, let's try and move this here."
"So I think freehanding is actually really helpful still to have.  [Maya Newlin] Specifically like, space planning.  [Maya Newlin] It always gets weird when you share screen and try and, like, zoom for some reason.  [Maya Newlin] Yep.  [Maya Newlin] Oh, okay, nice.  [Maya Newlin] I'll visualize it.  [Maya Newlin] Yeah, I think that's really nice.  [Maya Newlin] Yeah, definitely the before and after.  [Maya Newlin] Well, the first actually initial thought when I saw this was like, this kind of looks like Bluebeam."
"And we used to use obviously, Windows, people don't use it anymore because I have a Mac. yeah, I mean, Bluebeam was great because you would kind of do the same thing."
"You would add a comment, you can insert photos and then also do you like real time dimensioning?"
"So I think a feature that would be great is to actually.  [Maya Newlin] So like, I guess the PDF is to scale or it knows it'll read you know, doorways, three foot."
So you can actually measure in the draft or the PDF.  [Maya Newlin] So that would be something that's really.  [Maya Newlin] Like.  [Maya Newlin] So there would be a.
"Yeah, a ruler up top."
"Let's say you click the ruler and let's say you would measure, you know, between the staircase and that chair."
"Just be like, hey, this looks a little, like, tight."
Can we measure that distance?
"Because sometimes when you're drafting, you're."
"You put things together quickly and you're the size of you know, table, whatever is really off."
"Like, let me just go in and measure it."
"And you know, it's like, that's way too big."
"And so doing that's nice.  [Maya Newlin] Going back to like, the folder section, I think what would also be helpful specifically for renders and floor plans is like, nitpicky, is like, it would show a preview of the actual PDF or image and review versus I think that's actually really helpful to have so it show exactly what you're uploading."
"Kind of like, just because I'm assuming that let's say we're going to have six iterations of the same project going on."
"I want to know where we are in each one.  [Maya Newlin] So I guess I mean, you're showing the same plan, but let's say there, you know, was an image or something."
It would actually show that image with maybe the comments that person had wrote.
"So if there's red bubbles everywhere that I need to check, I don't know, I kind of like seeing like, how much I need to go into and review before just clicking and being like, my God, there's 50 red lines I need to pick up.  [Maya Newlin] Because sometimes I'm like, oh, I'm gonna leave this till the last minute."
"Because I know there's only three things to pick up versus if there's like, more than that, I'm like, I need to save time for this.  [Maya Newlin] Yeah, just like, again, it's just quicker than clicking in and actually looking again."
You want things really quickly.
"Yeah, that would be helpful for I think.  [Maya Newlin] And then if you go back into the floor plan."
"Yeah, so I like the recording in the comment section where you can record the video saying, you know, hey, if we try moving you know, 45 degrees or something?"
I think that's a really helpful feature.
"Okay, I think it would be helpful."
"I guess, like, let's say there's a lot of comments to review."
"If I'm reviewing a comment, it almost grays out."
"Like I read that versus, you know, need to go back because it might get confusing."
"Like, I don't know if I looked at this or not."
So almost like highlighting it out.
That's done.  [Maya Newlin] Right.
"Or it's you know, actually let's talk about this in person or something like that."
"Like, just a little item that.  [Maya Newlin] Maybe color.  [Maya Newlin] And then this is really fancy, but let's say I want all the comments picked up within this image that you shared."
Then I re upload the same exact export to the new folder.
"It would be interesting to see if the technology could catch if I forgot one of the red lines.  [Maya Newlin] Yeah, I don't know if that makes sense."
"Let's say I forgot to, you know, move the table or And we said we move it 90°, rotate it and I uploaded it and the table is in the same exact position."
"It would be so cool if it was like, hey, you didn't catch this because it would overlay it and it would be like, this is the same."
"That's really advanced.  [Maya Newlin] Yeah, exactly."
"Like, that would be again, another kind of safehold step to being like, okay, human error."
"Like, I forgot to do And then it's like, let me go fix that really quickly before the next person reviews it."
"It just like, saves time because usually you were in a rush when we're doing these things like, sometimes you just don't."
You forget to do it.  [Maya Newlin] So that'd be great.  [Maya Newlin] I think assuming that one person is the reviewer.
"I think it'd be interesting to have you know, this would be great for a firm where we're delegating, a junior designer to kind of pick up the comments."
"It would be nice if there was a partner version where, say, Jasmine and I are kind of looking at it And it's not like I have more than she does."
"It's kind of more collaborative versus, you know, hey, can you pick up these red lines?  [Maya Newlin] So I guess in this it's more action item of like, each person on the team is asking or saying, let's do And then the person reviewing is like, okay, Got that down."
"But if it's Jasmine and we want equal input, I guess what I'm commenting is not a full on action item that needs to be It's more of a comment to talk about.  [Maya Newlin] Or maybe."
"Yeah, it's like the color coding is just different or something.  [Maya Newlin] I mean, I think it's pretty standard when it comes to you know, your tools that are at the top and your comments, I feel like that looks fine to me.  [Maya Newlin] I think black and white is."
Is good for the base.
"Yeah, I don't like too much color.  [Maya Newlin] I'd say very valuable. like, Adobe is like, the worst."
"The Acrobat is like, the worst program to use it, like, sucks and it's always glitching."
"So I'd probably pay for it depending like, how much it costs.  [Maya Newlin] Okay."
"Maybe $20 a month, I or 19.99, let's say."
"But because we are like, we're kind of watching every subscription that we add on our plate."
"So, more realistically, right now, as of today, probably $10.  [Maya Newlin] Which is kind of like the Spotify subscription, you know, it like, feels right."
"Not too crazy because it's like we already have Adobe that we pay for and all of our other programs that like, add up.  [Maya Newlin] It's $69 because it's like you have to get all the suite."
And then we pay for our license for.
"We do actually do CAD on an hourly license, but we have like, SketchUp, Endscape."
I'm trying to think of the other ones.
"We don't do Revit right now. like, had to stop that because it's just don't use it."
It's so expensive.  [Maya Newlin] It's like it just never use Houzz.
"We have the free platform, but we're not like, work right now from there."
It's just referrals.  [Maya Newlin] That use it on Houzz?
"We don't have, like, a ton of experience with it."
"I feel like it's an easy, shopping platform."
"Like, you can integrate that.  [Maya Newlin] But maybe that's because they can, like, it keeps it all online versus, like, we don't have that many projects so we're kind of doing like, right from the ground if that makes sense."
"So it's probably just a volume thing.  [Maya Newlin] Like, almost like an Asana integration where it's."
More project task management.
"I feel like that would be like, up to, let's say, like, five users, so I wouldn't want to pay that per user.  [Maya Newlin] Like, I want the price to you know, up to a few users.  [Maya Newlin] We use a free version right now."
"I'd say it, like, gets the work done because, again, like, our team is not super huge."
It's not like we have to go in there every day.
"But back when were working with an architecture firm, we used it quite a bit you know, people were on different time zones and it actually worked for, like, delegating and, like, we paid for that version."
And so we actually kind of took the template from the previous.
"So we kind of took the template that she set up for it because it's, like, very organized and it's kind of once you work in a certain workflow, that's like, what you're used to.  [Maya Newlin] I don't know, would there be an app version so wouldn't just be desktop based?  [Maya Newlin] Okay, then I feel like, yeah, that's worth it."
"Maybe like 30, 40 then at the maximum.  [Maya Newlin] Exactly."
"Because there are a lot of free softwares out there where they let you do just enough to where it's like, okay, I can make this work and then everything else we'll just do, you know, over.  [Maya Newlin] I do like how Asana, you can do hours and tracking and there's a calendar view."
"So I mean, this would be interesting of like, okay, we want most of our renders done by this date and then you can kind of assign."
Let's say the file was on a timeline or something.
"Cause like, we're very visual people."
"Well, I'm a very visual person, so I like to kind of see things like designers are."
"Yeah. account. a live calendar, let's say."
"And so like, that's how I would like to look for things versus, going through the folder system."
"I feel like that would be interesting to see.  [Maya Newlin] Well, the way that you have it right now is yes, it's a folder, but there's an image to which is why I wanted the image to be actually live updated versus just it's saying PDF."
"So that does help me because it's I'm seeing that it's a folder, but I'm also recognizing like, oh, that iteration is from two months ago or, in a folder, there's still a visual side to it.  [Maya Newlin] But it will visualize it in a timeline of like, this is when things were edited, let's say."
"Like, I'm just imagining One of those, like, lighter, like, time things makes sense."
Comms process begins  [Maya Newlin] Because contractors don't look at their email ever.
"They're, only on the phone, usually by call, never by text. yes, I think this would be what."
"From what I'm seeing now, this is more like, an internal company use."
"Like, I don't think we would send this out to or share it with gcs, per se."
"Like, they kind of want, like, the final thing."
They don't really argue with what we send.
"They just, like, sure, build it."
"So I don't really see them, like, having input in, like, what we're doing.  [Maya Newlin] I think it sounds but I know, like, the GC wouldn't use it.  [Maya Newlin] Because that's just like, not how they."
"In my experience with all the GC's I worked with, that's just not how they work."
"I mean, maybe it would, like, take some time to get you."
For them to get used to.
Because they're very old school.
"But usually it's yeah, just email is the only."
"Or, you know, a quick call. but they, I don't think would be."
"They don't have time to be using another app.  [Maya Newlin] Oh, for like, designers.  [Maya Newlin] Oh, that's interesting.  [Maya Newlin] no, that is nice."
I don't think we would use it.
"Like, I don't foresee myself using that right now.  [Maya Newlin] Like, don't use WhatsApp, don't use Slack."
Most of our stuff's through Google Chat.
"It'll be like, check your."
"But I don't think email, like, I think being in email is really nice because the way we organize it, we have our folder system Or tag on email.  [Maya Newlin] I do like but I just don't think personally we would use it.  [Maya Newlin] I'm gonna say no."
"I mean, I could see it being but I wouldn't want to pay for both of them at the same time."
Let's say that there was an umbrella price.
"I would see them as two separate services that I would pay for.  [Maya Newlin] Yeah, that's what I was thinking."
"I was like, I wouldn't pay for both of them."
"I'd pay for maybe this, but not for the other one."
"Just because I don't use, let's say the other integrations."
So maybe it could be an add on.
"I would definitely.  [Maya Newlin] For your app testing?  [Maya Newlin] Yeah, I could definitely send over some references if you want."
"Well, I have graphic designers. unless you just want specifically interior architecture.  [Maya Newlin] Okay, I'll go through my contact list and see who'd be a good fit.  [Maya Newlin] Thank you so much."
